<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Unforeseen</span> circumstances having arisen since
the publication of the First Volume of this work,
which rendered it possible that the Author might be
unable to complete the narrative while holding the
appointment of Superintendent of the Regimental
Records, it has become necessary to modify the original
plan. There were two alternatives,&mdash;either to compress
the history between 1783 and the present date into one
volume, sacrificing many matters of minor interest,&mdash;or
to write, as fully as in the former volume, the
history of a period additional to that already treated
of, leaving the subsequent years and their campaigns
to be described either by the Author’s successor, or
by himself at some future time. After consultation
with some of the senior officers of the Corps, the
latter alternative has been adopted; and the addition
of certain statistical tables, and of a copious index to
both volumes, will, it is hoped, render the work, as
far as it goes, a complete one. Unless anticipated
by an abler pen, the Author does not despair of
being able to avail himself at some future time of
the continued access to the Regimental Records, now
systematically arranged, which has been promised to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
him by the Deputy Adjutant-General of the Corps,&mdash;with
a view to compiling narratives of the War in
the Crimea, and of the Indian Mutiny.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The almost unanimously kind reception given to
the first volume, not only by the press, but to a most
cheering extent by his brother officers, demands the
Author’s grateful acknowledgments. It has encouraged
him in the labours, the results of which are
now submitted to the public; and has satisfied him
that he did not err in the estimate he placed upon a
Regimental History, as a means of awakening and
intensifying <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>.

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Having</span> in the Preface stated the plan of this volume, it
is incumbent on the Author now to acknowledge, with
gratitude, the assistance he has received during its execution.
Acting on a suggestion made by one of the reviewers
of the first volume, he has noted in the margin the various
authorities on which the narrative is based; and, as in many
instances these are manuscript letters in the Record Office,
he has given the dates of such,&mdash;to facilitate access to them
by any one anxious to obtain information in detail.</p>

<p>Among those to whom the Author is chiefly indebted,
Sir Collingwood Dickson&mdash;for the reason stated in the body
of the work&mdash;stands first. Not only the Author, but the
Regiment at large, is indebted to him for the generous
confidence with which he entrusted the letters and journals
of his distinguished father to the writer of this history.
The labours of Captain G. E. W. Malet, R.A.&mdash;so visible
in the tables at the end of this volume&mdash;demand the next
place in the Author’s acknowledgment;&mdash;and the Reader
will be able to judge how great has been the value, to this
narrative, of the published writings of Captain H. W. L.
Hime, R.A.</p>

<p>Sir J. Bloomfield, Sir E. C. Warde, Sir D. E. Wood, General
Burke Cuppage, Major-Generals W. J. Smythe and C. J. B.
Riddell, Colonel Lynedoch Gardiner, Major H. Geary, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
Lieutenant J. Ritchie, have contributed valuable information
connected with the history of the Regiment to which they
belong, and have greatly facilitated the Author’s labours.
The assistance of Sir Edward Perrott, and of Captain H. W.
Gordon, C.B., is also gratefully acknowledged.</p>

<p>To Mr. James Browne, the author of ‘England’s Artillerymen’
a double debt is owing. His labour produced
the Index to the first volume; and his published work has
been a mine of reference, the value of which became more
apparent, the more it was explored. Written without the
adventitious aids at the disposal of the custodian of the
Regimental Records, it is yet so exhaustive and accurate,
that, when admiration of it has ceased, it is only because
that feeling has passed into envy.</p>

<p>The admirable Index to the present volume is due to the
skill, ability, and industry, eminently possessed by the
Assistant-Superintendent in the Record Office, R. H. Murdoch,

<p>The conducting a work of this description through the
press,&mdash;although the last occupation in point of time,&mdash;is
not the least in point of importance. Careful comparison
with the MSS.,&mdash;much patient and merely mechanical labour,&mdash;and
watchfulness, lest errors of style should be overlooked
in the anxiety to secure rigid accuracy, or lest the
latter should be sacrificed to attempts at literary embellishment,&mdash;all
these are involved in the process. And all these
have been displayed by one who has assisted in this operation,&mdash;the
Rev. G. Martyn Ritchie, Chaplain to the Forces,
whose services the Author acknowledges with gratitude.</p>

<p>Not unfrequently the official letter-books differ from
Kane’s List of Officers in the spelling of proper names.

given in the Index.</p>

<p>History moves so rapidly, that even while this work has
been in the press, a slight alteration in the pay of the
non-commissioned officers and men of the Regiment has
been made, making the rates given in the following pages
as those of the year 1873, accurate only up to the 1st of
October in that year. The reader can with ease make the
requisite corrections.

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Reaction</span> and retrenchment followed the Peace signed at
Versailles in 1783; and with them came dullness and
despondency in the Regiment. Until 1787, when the state
of France caused universal alarm in Europe, and preparations
for possible hostilities already commenced in England, the
prospects of promotion had been most disheartening. During
the American War, a large number of subaltern officers had
been appointed by the Generals serving with the English
armies, and it was found, in 1783, that in this respect the
establishment of the Regiment had been considerably exceeded.
With somewhat distorted ideas of justice, it was
ruled that the pay of the supernumeraries should be provided
by means of stoppages from the officers of all ranks on the
proper establishment, and that no new appointments should
be made until all the supernumeraries had been absorbed,&mdash;an
event which did not take place until the 14th February,
1786.</p>

<p>Dullness, therefore, reigned during these years in the
Warren at Woolwich,&mdash;dullness in the Academy,&mdash;dullness in
foreign stations, where the detachments were at times forgotten
altogether,&mdash;and dullness the most stupendous in the
offices of His Majesty’s Ordnance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

<p>Uneventful, however, as this period of the Regimental
History undoubtedly was, it possesses to the student a
peculiar interest. Its domestic details invite attention, as
representing the transition stage of the Regiment from a
past which had been glorious, to a future which was to be
more glorious still,&mdash;the last act, so to speak, of a drama in
which Artillery meant many things, but rarely implied mobility;
and a breathing-time, which admitted of much internal
organisation being perfected, which had been forgotten or
overlooked in the midst of war.</p>

<p>In the years between 1783 and 1792 there was much to
interest, much to amuse, and not a little to cause pain; but
the details, although necessary to be told, are wholly
domestic.</p>

<p>The strength of the Regiment remained until 1791 at
four Service Battalions, each consisting of ten companies, and
ten companies of invalids. In March 1791, two additional
companies were formed for service in the East Indies, but
they belonged to no particular Battalion. The companies,
which had been reduced to a minimum in 1783, were raised
to a greater establishment in 1787, a year in which recruiting
on a considerable scale was ordered, and never was wholly
suspended until after Waterloo. The bounty allowed to each
<span class="sidenote">R. A. Reg<sup>l</sup>.
Orders.</span>recruit was five guineas.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>The promotion consequent on the formation of the East
India Companies mentioned above was as follows:&mdash;1 Major,
3 Captains, 5 Captain-Lieutenants, and 9 First Lieutenants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letters to
the Master-General,
1783-92.</div>

<p>On the reduction in 1783, all men who were eligible were
transferred to the invalids, or to the out-pension list; and
men who were not entitled to that privilege, but who were
ordered to be discharged on reduction, received donations:&mdash;“If
<span class="sidenote">M. S. Reg<sup>l</sup>.
Orders.</span>
going to his home in Ireland, 38 days’ pay; to Scotland,
28 days’ pay; and if to any part of England, 14 days’
pay.”</p>

<p>Prior to the general recruiting in 1787, a special company
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
of artificers was raised&mdash;in 1786&mdash;for service in Gibraltar.
As these men were put under the officers of Engineers, a
Royal Warrant was issued on the 25th April, 1787, to define
the proper position of that Corps, the name of which was then
changed from the Corps of Engineers to the Corps of Royal
Engineers. The Warrant said: “Our said Corps of Royal
Engineers shall rank in our Army <i>with</i> our Royal Regiment
of Artillery; and whenever there shall be an occasion for
them to take part with any other Corps of our Army, the
post of the Royal Corps of Engineers shall be on the right
<i>with</i> the Royal Regiment of Artillery, <i>according to the
respective dates and commissions of the officers</i> belonging to
the Royal Regiment of Artillery, and the Corps of Royal
Engineers.”</p>

<p>The vagueness of this Royal Warrant, and the inconveniences
which might arise from it, were not lost upon the
officers of the senior Corps, who communicated their opinions
to the Master-General through Colonel Macbean, the Commandant
at Woolwich. On the 25th October, 1787, the Duke
of Richmond, having taken His Majesty’s pleasure, replied:
<span class="sidenote">Duke of
Richmond
to Colonel
F. Macbean.</span>
I have received the King’s commands to acquaint you that
His Majesty only meant the said Warrant to relate to the
circumstance when officers have occasion to parade by
themselves <i>without their men</i>, for a funeral or any other
military purpose; but that the directions contained in the
said Warrant are not to be understood to authorize any
officer of the Corps of Royal Engineers to take the command
of any detachment of the Royal Regiment of Artillery,
although he may be senior in rank to the oldest officer of
the said detachment, unless such officer of the Corps of
Royal Engineers should be the senior officer of the whole
Garrison or Command, when, by virtue of his commission,
he would of course take the command of the Royal Regiment
of Artillery with that of other troops. I am further
to signify to you His Majesty’s pleasure, that when any
companies or detachments of Royal Military Artificers and
Labourers are to take post, it is to be next to the Royal
Regiment of Artillery, <i>and upon their left</i>. And the officers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
of the Corps of Royal Engineers are on such occasions to
take post and fall in with such companies or detachments
of Royal Military Artificers and Labourers.”</p>

<p>Prior to the raising of this question of precedence between
the two Ordnance Corps, the general question of precedence
over the rest of the Army had been raised at Gibraltar in
1783, owing to the Governor having directed the Artillery
Guards to parade in the centre of the others, on general
guard-mounting parades. The commanding officer of Artillery,
Major Thomas Davies, having in vain protested, referred
the matter to the Master-General, who ordered the four
Colonels-Commandant of Battalions to assemble at Woolwich,
and report to him on the origin of the privilege claimed and
exercised by the Royal Artillery. The result was, that on
the 1st July, 1784, the Secretary at War wrote to the
<span class="sidenote">War Office,
1/7/84, to
Sir G. A.
Eliott.</span>
Governor of Gibraltar as follows: “The Duke of Richmond
having put into my hands your letter to him of the 24th
February last, together with the papers it refers to, touching
certain claims of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, first
stated in a representation of the officer commanding that
Corps at Gibraltar; and His Grace having desired me to
take the King’s pleasure thereon, I have accordingly had
the honour of submitting them to His Majesty, and am
commanded to acquaint you, that as the privilege claimed
by the Royal Artillery of taking the right upon all parades
appears to have been acknowledged and confirmed by a
Regulation given out in public orders to the Army by His
Royal Highness the late Duke of Cumberland, when Commander-in-Chief;
and, as that Regulation hath not yet been
cancelled, His Majesty considers the same to be still in
force, and is therefore pleased to direct that it shall be
adhered to on all occasions, when the compliance with it
will not be attended with material injury to the public
service.”</p>

<p>Next in importance to these questions of precedence,
among the Regimental events contained in the period of
which this chapter treats, comes the formation of a Head-quarter
office for the Regiment. Prior to 1783, each
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
Battalion was ruled by its own Colonel-Commandant, wherever
the companies might be serving; and details, which
should have been under the control of the senior Artillery
officer on the spot, were regulated from a distance. The
Ordnance Office was, in one sense, a Head-quarter office for
the Regiment; but a want existed of some <i>one military and
regimental</i> channel through which the wants and correspondence
of the Battalions might reach the Board. In a
letter to Captain Macleod, who was the first to hold this
much-needed office, the want was well expressed. “The
<span class="sidenote">Officer
commanding
R. A.,
Canada, to
Captain
Macleod,
7 Aug.,
1783.</span>
officers and men of different Battalions, that generally
compose commands of Artillery abroad, make the post of a
Brigade-Major obviously useful to prevent a multiplicity
of returns to different Battalions, which must often fall
short of the information required at home. The enclosed
return, for instance, will show that we have officers here
without a knowledge of what Battalion they belong to.”
The appointment of Captain&mdash;afterwards Sir John&mdash;Macleod
was a very fortunate one. He was styled Brigade-Major,
when appointed in 1783; and in 1795 the designation was
altered to that of Deputy-Adjutant-General. In 1806 an
Assistant-Adjutant-General was added to the office; and in
1859, a Deputy-Assistant-Adjutant-General. When Captain
Macleod was first appointed, he was under the orders of the
Commandant of Woolwich Garrison; but in a very short
time he made himself so useful to the Master-General and
the Board, and was so conversant with all those details
which could not possibly be familiar to officers, who were so
frequently changed, as the Commandants were in those days,
that most of the Regimental correspondence soon passed
<i>direct</i> between him and the Board. So delicate a position
required great tact, and this quality Captain Macleod
eminently possessed. Appearing to act under the orders of
the Commandant, and courteously anticipating his wishes,
he really was the mouthpiece of the Board in controlling
the affairs of the Regiment. His correspondence is a masterpiece
of courtesy, skill, and clearness. “The leading feature
<span class="sidenote">Memoir of
Sir J.
Macleod,
‘United
Service
Journal,’
July 1834.</span>
of his character was the confidence he inspired in others,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
and the unbounded trust they reposed in him; and thus,
whether called upon for counsel, or to act under unforeseen
or sudden emergencies of service, he was ever ready
and prepared to meet its exigencies.... Of every soldier
he made himself the friend. To his equals in rank he was
a brother; to those beneath him a father in kindness and
counsel; and to the private soldiers a benefactor, ever watching
over their comfort and their welfare.... Throughout
his long career he was never known to act with the
slightest approach to severity; and yet he never failed to
maintain discipline, to reprove fault, or to check irregularity.
He animated zeal, excited energy, and aimed at
perfecting discipline by always appealing to the better
and nobler feelings that prevail with the soldier’s character.”
An office, which, with an ordinary man, would have remained
always subordinate, was raised by him so as to be the very
centre of the Regimental life; and although there have
been times in its history, when the progress and success of
the Regiment have been rather in spite, than by means of
it, these occasions have been rare; and&mdash;as in the case of
the commencement of the Peninsular War&mdash;were forgotten
in the exertions which followed them. In a Regiment so
large, and so scattered, the value of some central organization,
not merely for <i>routine</i>, but also for maintaining and
encouraging <i>esprit de corps</i>, can hardly be overrated.</p>

<p>It has been said that Captain Macleod commenced to hold
the new office, as a Brigade-Major. It may be added that
the ideas of a Brigade-Major’s position were not exalted.
From 1783 to 1790, Captain Macleod conducted all his
business in one small room, shared by his clerks, two in
number; but in 1790, offices having been provided for the
Adjutants of the Battalions, who had hitherto been made to
work together, the Brigade-Major was allowed the same privilege,
and drew lots with the others&mdash;according to custom&mdash;for
a separate apartment. In a long official correspondence, extending
over a long lifetime, the only irritation displayed by
Sir John Macleod was at the official delays of the Board for
which he laboured. But, even then, his indignation took the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
form of gentle irony. Whether writing, as he did in the
end of the year 1786, requesting that his travelling allowances
for 1783 might be sent him with as little delay as
possible, or reminding the Board of a demand for stationery
sent in many months before, he was never disturbed into
strong language. “I hope you will forgive me,” he wrote,
<span class="sidenote">To B. of
Ordnance,
9 Dec.,
1784.</span>
with reference to his last-named demand, “for begging you
to <i>give orders for its going through the different forms</i> with
as much expedition as possible, the stationery of last year
being now entirely exhausted.” An amusing instance of
his quiet way of answering criticism from underlings at the
Ordnance occurred in 1785. Many people who had assisted
the troops during the American War came to England, and
generally applied for Government assistance. A negro,
named James Buchanan, presented himself at the Ordnance,
and requested assistance, on the plea that he had been
employed during the war as a labourer with one of the
companies on service. The case was referred to the Brigade-Major,
who replied that no such man was to be found on
the rolls of the men so employed. The man, still adhering
to his statement, was told to go to Woolwich and endeavour
to substantiate it. On doing so, he was at once recognized
by Captain Macleod as a man who had done duty with his
own company; and he reported accordingly.</p>

<p>The opportunity could not be resisted; and some official
of the Board wrote an offensive demand for explanation of
the contradictory statements made by the Brigade-Major.
With quiet sarcasm, Captain Macleod wrote: “The Board
will easily understand my inconsistency in disclaiming one
day and acknowledging the next, when I inform them that
their petitioner <i>has acquired the name of James Buchanan,
by being christened since his arrival in England</i>.”</p>

<p>The dullness at the Board, consequent on the retrenchment
which had to be practised, was cheered by the genial
kindness of the Master-General, the Duke of Richmond, who
displayed the greatest interest in the military branch, down
to the humblest individual. To the student it is also varied
by exasperating anecdotes, illustrating the perfection of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
official doubt and criticism. The return from America of
the companies, many of whose men had been in prison at
various periods during the war, offered admirable opportunities
for the practice of virtues which were strongly
represented at the Honourable Board. To a man landing at
Woolwich, the sympathy of the Ordnance took the doubtful
form of a peremptory order to refund, it might be, certain
moneys which had been drawn for him while a prisoner of
war,&mdash;their welcome home was a disallowance. As for the
Captains of the returning companies, they were allowed no
peace. No consideration was given on account of their men
having been scattered over a whole continent; the same
minuteness of detail, the same superabundance of vouchers
for every charge, was demanded, as if their companies had
never left Woolwich Warren. One Captain, unable to give
the exact dates and sufficient proofs of the deaths of certain
men, who had been killed on distant detachments, was rash
enough to question the justice of such a demand, and to
point out the difficulties in the way of its compliance. Misguided,
miserable man! Little did he know the system of
audit, which prevailed in the year of grace 1784. Argument
was inadmissible; the full pound of flesh, in the form of
vouchers and authorities, was insisted on by the official
Shylocks; and if circumstances rendered this an absolute
impossibility, their remedy was simple. Of this wretched
<span class="sidenote">Ordnance
Letter-book,
1784.</span>
Captain, we read that “an order was sent to the agent
to stop his pay until the sum of 223<i>l.</i> had been
paid.”</p>

<p>In the correspondence of the period, this officer’s name
does not appear again for some weeks,&mdash;but then in a startling
manner. In a letter to the Commandant of Woolwich
from the Surgeon of the 4th Battalion, we find that the ill-fated
Captain “was so violent last night that I had to put a
strait waistcoat on him.” Had he received notice of a
fresh disallowance from his unfeeling auditors? This, indeed,
does not appear; but from the fact that he had been
perfectly sane before this correspondence, and recovered his
sanity afterwards, it almost appears as if his reason had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
tottered under the admirable system of audit, which made
no allowance, and would listen to no argument.</p>

<p>The consistency of these examiners was as admirable, as
their pertinacity or their indifference. They were no less
reluctant to part with money except on abundant evidence,
than they were determined to have it refunded unless similar
evidence could be shown for its retention. From the dull
pages of the Brigade-Major’s letter-books we learn of a just
and lawful claim made by a gunner on his return from New
York. It does not appear that the claim was denied, but
the line taken by the suspicious officials was to doubt the
man’s identity. The difficulty of proving this may be
imagined from what followed. The usual evidence which
the man himself could produce was, like his assertion,
scornfully rejected. A certificate from an officer under
whom he had served, and who was then at Woolwich, was
not considered sufficient, even when followed by a second
and third of the same description, and from different officers.
According to their own documents, the examiners said
the man had died in New York; and they would hear of no
resurrection. The matter reached the Commandant, who
took it up warmly. A little alarmed, but not convinced, the
auditors wrote to Bath to ask General Pattison, who had
commanded at New York at the date of the man’s supposed
death, whether it had not taken place. But they mistook
their correspondent. He replied that he had no means of
answering their question, but he added, “I should hope that
certificates from three respectable officers, accompanied
with a recommendation from the Commanding Officer of
the Battalion, who I am very confident would not have
offered any but on the very surest grounds, will be deemed
sufficient vouchers of the poor man’s pretensions.” From
the subsequent cessation of the correspondence, it is presumed
that the claimant’s identity was at last admitted.</p>

<p>At no period of the Regiment’s history was the paternal
rule of the Board more detailed, and more inclusive of the
veriest trifles. The incessant references which had to be
made by the Commandant, before he could make the slightest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
change in the Garrison, and the constant petty collisions
between the civil and military departments, picture to the
student an intolerable <i>régime</i>. Nor was the overbearing of
the civilian officials confined to offensive correspondence. A
story is handed down of a mighty servant of the Board,
rejoicing in the title of “Clerk of the Cheque,” who paid
periodical visits to Woolwich, and evinced his scorn for the
military branch in every way. On one day, the Commandant
had ordered the troops to parade for his inspection; and
sentries were placed at various points to keep back the crowd
of sightseers, which had assembled. Just as the Commandant
came on the ground, a scuffle was observed taking
place between a sentry and one of the crowd. The Garrison
Sergeant-Major was sent to ascertain the cause; and on his
arrival he found the Clerk of the Cheque insisting on his
right to ignore any military control. The Sergeant-Major
argued, but without success; the intruder said he was Clerk
of the Cheque, and demanded admission. From verbal to
physical persuasion was the next step; and <i>both</i> the military
individuals flung themselves on their civil rival. It was
without result; strong in the majesty of his office, the Clerk
of the Cheque held his ground. The disturbance at length
drew the Commandant himself to the spot, and he took up
the discussion; and, like the Sergeant-Major, resorted to
the argument of physical force. It was an awful moment;
as he reads of it, the student’s blood runs cold; for the
battle was now condensed into a fight for the superiority of
the civil over the military branch of His Majesty’s Ordnance.
And for the moment the Clerk of the Cheque prevailed:&mdash;pushing
the Commandant on one side, he swaggered across
the enclosure. But his triumph was short-lived; the matter
was reported to the Master-General, who ordered the
offender to proceed to Woolwich and make a public apology.
Doubtless, however, he expiated the humiliation by some of
the many ways of paper irritation, which he had at his
disposal.</p>

<p>The delay in executing repairs and meeting demands was
excessive. Twelve months were not considered too long a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
period to answer a requisition, and much longer was generally
taken. A fence happened to require repair in front of
the barracks, and its dangerous state was repeatedly pointed
out by the Commandant. But not until years had passed
and an officer had killed his horse, and broken his own collar-bone,
did any steps occur to the Board to remedy it. Even
then, while they were brooding, accidents continued, coming
to a climax one night, when “the Chaplain, in walking
<span class="sidenote">General
Cleaveland
to B. of
Ordnance.</span>
home, fell in and broke the principal ligament of his leg.”</p>

<p>A temporary chapel existed in the Warren, and, although
the duties of the Chaplains will be discussed hereafter, it
may be mentioned, while considering the Board’s delays,
that in 1783 the Chaplain applied for “a cushion and furniture
for the pulpit, a surplice, Bible and prayer-books,
and a few hassocks, those in use having been purchased in
1753.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1787.
Rev. E.
Jones to
B. of Ordnance.</div>

<p>After patiently waiting for <i>four</i> years, the Chaplain again
sent in a demand, stating that it was <i>impossible</i> to use those
he had <i>any longer</i>.</p>

<p>The procrastination of the Board led, as may be imagined,
to many inconveniences. A company in the Bahamas was
ordered to be in readiness to return to England, and no
clothing was sent to it for the year 1784, as the Board
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Macbean to
Master-General,
Feb. 9,
1787.</span>
promised to make immediate arrangements for its transport;
but 1784 passed, and also 1785, and then 1786, and no
transport was forthcoming, nor was any clothing sent for
these three years.</p>

<p>It is a relief, however, to turn from the Board and its
shortcomings, and to study the purely Regimental details of
the period. Tame, and uninteresting, as they may appear
beside the terrible seedtime in France, where the dragon’s-teeth
of discord, licence, and rebellion were being scattered,
to bring forth a thirty years’ harvest in Europe of armed
men, they cannot be passed by in any work pretending to
tell the story of the Regiment. They speak of an interior
economy which has utterly disappeared,&mdash;of a time which
might fitly be called “the age of the Colonels-Commandant.”
So completely <i>honorary</i> has that rank now become in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
Regiment, that the exercise of one small piece of patronage&mdash;the
nomination of the Brigade Adjutant and Quartermaster&mdash;is
the only link which connects those who hold it
with the active duties of the Corps.</p>

<p>On the 30th January, 1873, the Colonels-Commandant
were invited to leave their retirement, and to meet their
brother officers once again at the Regimental mess. This
rare <i>réunion</i> formed a marked contrast to the days referred
to in this chapter. <i>Then</i>, the Colonels-Commandant of the
four Battalions were entitled to live in barracks in the
Warren; and an attempt was made to place them on the
same roster for duty as the Colonels. Thanks to the conscientious
and far-seeing judgment of the officers who then
held the rank, this order was cancelled. The following
protest, submitted by them to the Master-General, will
sufficiently explain the situation<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
the Master-General,
Sept. 1785,
from
Major-Generals
Cleaveland,
Pattison,
Brome, and
Godwin.</div>

<p>“With respect to the proposition of the 1st and 2nd
Colonels of the Battalion quartered at Woolwich to take
the duty alternately of being always on the spot, and
commanding there, we beg leave to say (if by 1st Colonel
is meant Colonel-Commandant) that, as General Officers,
we are under the necessity of dissenting from it. We
wish to look up to your Grace as the guardian and protector,
under our gracious Sovereign, of the Corps of
Artillery, as well <i>individually</i> as <i>collectively</i>; and, therefore,
as this measure would be derogatory thereto, we
trust that your Grace, having condescended to ask our
opinions, will be pleased to relinquish it. Your Grace is
sensible that by the custom of the Army immemorially
established, and confirmed by the Royal sanction, Colonels
having the rank of General Officers are exempted from
being stationary with their Regiments; and that, by a
late regulation, even Lieut.-Colonels having the rank of
Major-General are not required to be with their Regiments
any further than they may judge necessary for
becoming responsible for their being in good order and
discipline, the care and command devolving upon the
Major or senior Captain. However faint, my Lord, our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
prospects may be of deriving equal advantages with other
General Officers, from the rank we have the honour to
hold, we have yet every reason to believe and expect that
the privileges annexed to it will be equally preserved to
us. In the year 1773, the late Master-General was pleased
to give an order, which seemed to <i>require</i> the residence of
the Colonels-Commandant at Woolwich, whereupon the
late Generals Belford and Desaguliers had an audience of
His Majesty, and laid at his feet a memorial praying for
redress, which His Majesty was graciously pleased to
grant.”</p>

<p>Although, however, relieved of a duty beneath their rank,
the connection of the Colonels-Commandant with their
Battalions remained of the closest description. No officer
was allowed to be promoted, under the rank of Field-Officer,
without a recommendation from the Colonel-Commandant of
the Battalion in which he might be serving; nor was any
exchange allowed without the consent of both the Colonels-Commandant
concerned. The recruiting, clothing, and discharges
of the men were under the same control; and the
private affairs of the officers were also frequently the subject
of their official consideration. It has been already hinted, at
the commencement of this chapter, that for some reasons the
period between 1783 and 1792 is a painful one to study. It
is impossible to give a sufficient reason; but as to the <i>fact</i>,
there is no doubt that there was then a bad spirit among
some of the younger officers, which manifested itself not
unfrequently in acts of open insubordination. The pages of
the Ordnance letter-books of this time bristle with accounts
of courts-martial on officers, an occurrence most rare before
or since. Nor were they due to any stern, unforgiving discipline,
visiting slight offences with heavy punishment. The
offences were all of one description,&mdash;distinct and grave
insubordination. Whether sufficient care had not been taken
in the appointment of officers during the American War, or
whether this war had engendered among some an unruly,
ill-disciplined, and impatient spirit, it is impossible now to
say. Nor was tragedy wanting. One case occurred, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
1785, of an officer who had been commissioned in America
during the war, and who, on his return to England, had
been repeatedly guilty of minor offences. A prolonged
absence without leave brought matters to a crisis. He was,
after some difficulty, traced to a low lodging-house in London,
and, after many unavailing orders to return to Woolwich,
was at last brought down by escort. A general court-martial
was assembled for his trial at the Horse Guards,
where all such courts were then held; and from the official
registers it can be traced that he was convicted. Before,
however, the sentence was promulgated, we learn from a
letter in the Brigade-Major’s correspondence that he was
found one morning dead in his room. No explanation is
given,&mdash;merely a brief report of the occurrence, leaving the
reader to his own conjectures as to the manner and the
cause.</p>

<p>But, painful as it is to come across such passages, the pain
is almost forgotten in the pleasure which the same correspondence
affords, when treating of the earnest fatherly
interest displayed by the Colonels-Commandant in the young
officers under their control. In later days, the life and progress
of the Regiment have been, as a rule, in the keeping of
its younger members; but, at the time now spoken of, it was
emphatically the devotion of the fathers of the Corps, which
tided it over the shoals of discontent, stagnation, and despair.
A jealous love of their noble traditions animated them; they
had all shared the toils and the honours, which had so welded
the Regiment into a glorious unity; and they laboured with
an unselfish love to inspire the younger members with an
<i>esprit</i>, which should make them worthy channels of their
own deep feelings.</p>

<p>They expressed in the earnestness of their lives that which
was said in words by one of the Colonels-Commandant at the
<i>réunion</i> in 1873, mentioned above: “The glory of our Regiment
<span class="sidenote">General B.
Cuppage.</span>
has been in our keeping; but we are now old and
passing away, and we commit it to you.” How much of
the noble spirit which animated the Corps in the commencement
of this century was due to the unwearying teaching of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
the older officers at the period now treated of can never be
told; but the student of the correspondence still preserved
cannot but attribute to it an abundant share.</p>

<p>One of the duties always performed at this time by the
Field-Officers of the Corps was the testing the value of new
inventions. The list of such during this period is long and
quaint. The inventors were both professional Artillerymen
and amateurs; although it must be confessed that the latter
received greater encouragement than the former. It seems
hardly credible, but it is a fact, that in the year of grace 1790
the Field-Officers of Artillery were repeatedly assembled to
examine into the merits of a 3-pounder <i>leather</i> gun, invented
by Sir John Sinclair. Nor were rifled guns unknown at this
time. One of the most persistent inventors was a Mr.
Wiggins, who produced rifled guns to fire belted spherical
shot. He succeeded with the smaller guns, 1 and 9-pounders;
but was not successful with the larger. An 18-pounder
which he produced before the Board was certainly not a
success; for, on firing two rounds with common proof-charge
and one shot, “on the second round it burst into a great
<span class="sidenote">Inspector
of Artillery
to
Commandant.</span>
number of pieces.” Although, however, the Field-Officers
were available for this duty, any interference with the manufacturing
departments in the Arsenal by the Garrison officials
was not allowed nor tolerated. There were repeated attempts
made by successive Commandants to assume a control over
the Arsenal, but without success.</p>

<p>Another duty which occupied the senior officers at this
time was connected with the Regimental Hospital and the
medical officers of the Ordnance. Complaints were repeatedly
made <i>by</i> the Surgeons, and not without reason; and complaints
were often made <i>of</i> them, but generally without
cause. The system of making the Surgeon find medicines
for the sick, out of a fixed and inadequate money allowance
led to much correspondence; and attempts made to extort
from the military surgeon any charges made by a civil practitioner
for attendance on men on furlough led to very
stormy remonstrances. On the other hand, the varying rate
of stoppages made from the pay of the sick led to discontent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
on <i>their</i> part. It was actually proposed by the Board to
take away the whole of a man’s pay when in hospital, lest
the Captains of Companies should be induced to send men
when in debt into hospital, and to appropriate the balance
of their pay. This unworthy suspicion was resented by the
Colonels-Commandant in the following dignified words:
<span class="sidenote">Dated
4 July,
1786.</span>
With regard to the temptation which might induce a
Captain to send his men to the hospital, and keep them
there as long as he could, in order to clear their debts by
stoppages&mdash;we hope, and, indeed, are confident, that there
is no Captain now in the Corps of so illiberal a mind as
to be thus unworthily attentive to his own interest
in preference to that of His Majesty’s service; and
should there ever be hereafter any one of such bad principles,
a collusion must take place between him, the
Surgeon, and the Soldier, before his base purpose could
be accomplished.”</p>

<p>The Regulations for the Ordnance Medical Department
were embodied in a distinct form in the years 1786 and 1787,
but not without much meeting of committees and examination
of witnesses. Much of the labour and expense which
fell upon the medical officers at Woolwich were caused by the
presence in that Garrison of 150 men of the Invalid Battalion,
who were incessantly under treatment. It cannot be said
that men were driven out of the service in those days without
every endeavour being made to effect a cure. From the lists
of men recommended for discharge in the year 1791, which
are deposited in the Record Office, we find that one had been
“sick in the country for <i>four years</i>;” another suffered from
rheumatism, loss of sight and of hearing; another had
“an inveterate sore leg of many years’ standing;” another
was “insane, and burthensome to the Battalion;” another
“hectic, and subject to fits;” another “hurt in the back, and
otherwise infirm;” while a very common epithet was
“completely worn out.” There were other grounds, however,
for discharging men, than mere medical. One man
has been handed down as having been discharged because
“he was unsightly,” another was “unpromising,” a third
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
“irregular,” while of a fourth the curt characteristic placed
against his name is the word “thief.”</p>

<p>History frequently repeats itself in small matters as well
as large. The legislation suggested by the present Secretary
of State for War, with reference to men who have occasion to
go to hospital on account of their own indiscretion, was in
force in Canada for many years prior to 1791,&mdash;a fine of
10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> being levied from every Artilleryman in such a
position. A commanding officer, however, went to Canada
who declined to enforce this fine; and the question as to
the origin and duration of the custom was therefore referred
to the Commandant at Woolwich. He replied: “From
the Brigade-Major I learn the custom has long been abolished
in Woolwich, and in other places, as tending to
induce the soldier to conceal his complaint, or apply to
quacks for a cheaper cure; both of which may be prejudicial
to his constitution.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Whitehall,
23 May,
1786.</div>

<p>The decisions arrived at by the Board in 1786, with reference
to the medical officers, may be briefly stated. The
principal medical officer at Woolwich was to be called
Surgeon-General, and was to receive half-pay of 10s. per
diem, while he was to be relieved of the expense of finding
any medicines for the hospital. The Surgeon of the Battalion
at Woolwich had to provide all the medicines for his
Battalion, “excepting bark and wine,” in return for which
he was allowed 120<i>l.</i> per annum. The Surgeon of the Battalion
detached in England remained at Woolwich with such
companies of the Battalion as might be stationed there,
providing the medicines required by them, and by the
company in Scotland, as well as all the companies of the
Battalion <i>when on the line of march</i>,&mdash;receiving in return
remuneration at the rate of 12<i>l.</i> per company annually. The
recruits of the Battalions abroad were also under his care,
and he received 12<i>l.</i> annually for each detachment of fifty
men, in return for the medicines he had to provide. So far,
this Surgeon had little to complain of. But the next burden
was always greater than he could bear. He had to take
charge of the men of the Invalid Battalion, not merely those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
at Woolwich, but also those on detachment, furnishing them
with medicines, in return for the annual sum of 70<i>l.</i> When
one bears in mind that no man entered the Invalid Battalion
until he was completely crippled, and that his daily medicine
was probably as necessary to him as the air he breathed, the
inadequacy of the Surgeon’s remuneration in this item
becomes apparent. The Surgeons of the Battalions, to which
the companies at Gibraltar and in Canada respectively
belonged, went on service with these companies, and received
12<i>l.</i> per annum for each company, in addition to their pay&mdash;in
return for which they had to provide all medicines
“except bark and wine.” The same allowance was paid for
detached companies of the various Battalions to the Ordnance
Surgeon on the spot. Civil artificers and labourers in the
employ of the Ordnance were entitled to medical attendance
and medicines, by paying at the rates of one penny and one
halfpenny <i>per week</i> throughout the year to the Ordnance
medical officer on the station. The rule with regard to
officers was worded as follows: “It is expected that the
Surgeons of the Artillery and Ordnance at the different
places should give their attendance to the military and
civil officers without fee; but, with respect to supplying
them with medicines, it is recommended to the military and
civil officers to subscribe 2 guineas a year each, for which
the Surgeon is to supply them with medicines; otherwise
they are to pay for such medicines as they use.”</p>

<p>Such were the regulations for the medical officers of the
Ordnance,&mdash;revealing a system which was faulty and has
disappeared, but which it is interesting to reproduce in a
history of the Corps. But there were other non-combatants
also&mdash;no longer represented in the Regiment, but who
deserve to be mentioned&mdash;the Regimental Chaplains. These
gentlemen, at the period treated of, did not belong, as now,
to one department for general Army service, but belonged
to the various Battalions of the Corps. This, however, did
not imply that they did duty with their Battalions; far from
it. Excellent men, they drew their pay with a punctuality
worthy of all praise, but it was not among their congregations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
in the Warren, but away in quiet rural rectories&mdash;in
fat livings which they held. They were pluralists; and
they clubbed together to pay a curate in Woolwich to perform
their joint duties. It is sad to have to say, also, that
they did not pay their substitute very liberally. They
paid him each eighteen-pence a day&mdash;a sum so inadequate
that it drew forth the remonstrances of the Commandant,
who wrote to the Master-General that, “considering the
<span class="sidenote">Commandant
to
Master-General,
Nov. 14,
1787.</span>
reverend gentleman’s constant residence and attendance,
his dress and appearance, which are always obliged to be
decent, and the disadvantage of having no surplice fees to
add to it, it will not permit him even to eat at the mess&mdash;the
cheapest and best mode of living here.” The sum of
two shillings and sixpence a day from each Chaplain was
requested for their substitute; such as was given in other
Garrisons. It will thus be seen that the system was officially
recognised; and, indeed, was but one of the many vicious
customs which have disappeared before public opinion.
There were certain occasions when the attendance of the
Chaplains was insisted upon, although they were few and
far between. One such occurred in 1785, when the King
announced his intention of coming to Woolwich to review
the Regiment. The Chaplains were hurriedly written for,
“in order,” wrote the Brigade-Major, “that you may be
at Woolwich in proper time to <i>march by</i> with the Regiment.”
One of the number replied, that on account of the
distance at which he lived, and the fact of his being 86 years
of age, he would be unable to attend,&mdash;which he greatly
regretted, as he would have much liked to march past again
before he died. The others obeyed the summons, one only
protesting a little on the ground that the Battalion to
which he belonged was at that time scattered in the West
Indies and Canada. A few years later, in 1792, when a
camp was formed at Bagshot, the Chaplains were ordered to
attend and encamp with the companies; and from that time
their duties ceased, more and more every year, to be so
purely honorary as they had been.</p>

<p>Returning now to the combatant part of the Corps, there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
are certain details connected with the dress of the officers
and men, which can hardly fail to be interesting, and which
find a natural place in a chapter like this. Owing to a
circumstance arising out of the American War, we are fortunately
in possession of very circumstantial accounts on this
point. After the Convention of Saratoga, many of the
officers of Burgoyne’s army remained prisoners of war for
nearly three years. On their return to England, they
claimed compensation for loss of their equipment, &amp;c.,
stating their case as follows:&mdash;“The subscribers wish to
represent the constant and unavoidable loss they sustained
in the mode of payment of their subsistence, as the impossibility
of supplying the Convention Army with specie
laid them under an absolute necessity of drawing their pay
at very extravagant rates, being paid by public bills, in
the negotiation of which, from the Congress paper currency,
they suffered a discount which in the 1st year may
be estimated at 20 per cent.... We beg leave to observe
that, in conformity to the wishes of the Generals commanding
the troops, we were under the necessity of building
huts at our own cost and charges, in order to take the
more effectual care of the men, to attend to their wants
and to alleviate their distresses. Much expense was
incurred on this score. We have also to observe that the
Congress at different periods obliged us to remove to most
of the provinces in America; and in those several marches
of at least 1500 miles, it must naturally occur that many
and heavy charges were sustained by us. On being
exchanged, we were unavoidably obliged to come to New
York individually, and there being no public conveyance,
we were necessitated to purchase horses, to transport ourselves
and baggage, from people who took every advantage
of our distresses,” On the claims of officers on this
account reaching the Ordnance, the first step was, simply, to
refuse to admit them; on their being urged again in
stronger terms, the next step was to refer them to some one
else to ascertain the truth of the claimants’ statements, it being
an official axiom that any one demanding money was probably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
an impostor, and to be treated accordingly; and, lastly, on
being satisfied of the accuracy of the claim, the invariable
course was to offer something considerably less than the sum
demanded. From a remonstrance made against the offer in
this case we learn what was laid down by the Board of
Ordnance in the previous year, 28th June, 1782, as the
equipment of an Artillery Subaltern, and the cost at which
it was to be valued in compensating for its loss by shipwreck,
or imprisonment. It was as follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The annual issues of clothing were settled by the Master-General
on 17th March, 1788, to be as follows.</p>

<p>Each sergeant was to receive annually</p>

<p class="table">

1 white cloth waistcoat.<br />
1 white cloth breeches.<br />
1 <i>frilled</i> shirt.<br />

<p>The same articles were supplied to the other ranks, with
the exception that while the corporal’s coat had two epaulettes,
the bombardier’s had only one; and that the hats of
the drummers were plain, instead of gold-laced. The drummers
had also fur caps supplied to them when required. In
the West Indies the men received white linen waistcoats and
breeches, instead of cloth; and wore white gold-laced hats
instead of black.</p>

<p>The men of the Invalid Battalion received the same
articles as those of the Marching Battalions, with this
exception, that their coats were lined with <i>red</i> instead of
white, and their waistcoats and breeches, instead of being
white, were <i>blue</i>.</p>

<p>So much for the clothing of the Regiment at this time; a
few words must now be said as to its drills. And perhaps
this can be done most easily by describing a field-day, which
took place on the morning of the 9th July, 1788, before the
King. On the arrival of His Majesty, a salute of 21 guns,
at intervals of 8 seconds, was fired by a company, which
immediately afterwards fell in on the left of the line. It
was not until the preceding year that the Regiment had
<span class="sidenote">Order by
Master-General,
4 July,
1787.</span>
been ordered to fall in in two ranks, when under arms. The
King having ridden down the ranks, the Regiment broke
into open column, and marched past in slow and quick time.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
The line having been reformed, and the Manual Exercise
practised, the following marvellous evolutions commenced:&mdash;Two
rounds were fired from <i>flanks to centre</i> of each Battalion;
the line then retired one hundred yards towards the
Barracks, and fired two rounds from <i>centre to flanks</i> of each
Battalion; and then returned to its former ground. Here
it fired two rounds by grand divisions from flanks to centre
of each Battalion; then one round by wings of each
Battalion; and, finally, each Battalion fired a volley.</p>

<p>Having so rung the changes on small-arm firing, a certain
number of the men were detached to man 12 field guns, the
line opening to allow these guns to come up. As a contrast
to modern Field Battery drill, the solemn orders issued to
the officer commanding these guns may be quoted:&mdash;“Lieutenant-Colonel
Walker will advance towards Woolwich
Common with his 12 guns, 4 in front, and in three lines.
This column will incline to the right, so that the right-hand
gun may be near the right-hand hedge. When they have
got about halfway between the front of the Barracks and
the sunk fence, the 4 guns in the front line are then to
halt, while the 4 guns in the centre line form the left of
the front line. The 12 guns then in one line will fire
two rounds from <i>flanks to centre</i>, then change their front
to the left by wheeling on the centre, and in that position
fire two rounds from <i>centre to flanks</i>. The 6 guns on the
right will then fall in with the rear of the 2nd Battalion,
and the 6 guns on the left will fall in with the rear of the
4th Battalion.”</p>

<p>It requires the reproduction of such elephantine movements
as the above, to realise sufficiently the progress made
since that time in Field Artillery. This most wooden style
of drill was the fashion in England; and we owe the change,
which followed to the wars of the French Revolution, which
taught that a General, to win battles, must be something
more than a drill-sergeant, and that an army must learn
not merely to fight, but to move, and to move with rapidity.
The only element in the field-day just described which
gives the student the slightest relief, is a mention made that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
the Gentlemen Cadets were employed as Light Infantry
towards the end of the day. Of course this was all wrong,
and one would rather find that they had been employed on a
public occasion like this, as Artillerymen; but it is a relief
to read of anything implying rapidity of movement, after
the dull, ponderous description of the line moving solemnly
backwards and forwards, firing from flanks to centre, and
centre to flanks.</p>

<p>To this style of drill our want of success in Flanders, in
the campaigns shortly to be described, was mainly due.
Our Generals had their brains so saturated with the drill-book,
that on active service, if they encountered an enemy
who violated its rules, they were utterly nonplussed. Had
they won a victory by ignoring the regulations under which
they had been so strictly exercised, their satisfaction would
have been but a doubtful one. They had yet to learn that
although drill and dogged courage are admirable qualities in
troops, they will not compensate for the lack of those qualities
in a General which are necessary to ensure success.</p>

<p>Only one or two points remain to be noticed. First, the
amalgamation of the Royal Irish Artillery was contemplated
as early as 1788, although it did not take place until after
the Union in 1801. The delay was mainly caused by the
protest of the officers of the Royal Artillery, who would
have suffered greatly from supersession,&mdash;the promotion in
the Irish corps having been much more rapid than in that
from which it sprang. Amalgamation must always produce
this supersession to a certain extent; and the Board listened
to the remonstrances, and deferred the incorporation of the
Irish Artillery for some years. About the same date
that this question was being discussed, a long petition
was forwarded from Gibraltar, in which the officers of
the Royal Artillery there stationed pointed out how much
better the position had become of officers in the Royal
Engineers of the same standing as themselves, than their
own. The wording of the petition was faulty, and its
arguments were unsound; thus giving the Master-General
an opportunity, of which he availed himself, to administer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
a dignified rebuke to the malcontents. On one point,
however, he admitted the force of their complaint. The
rank of Major had been abolished in the Royal Engineers,
its holders being made Lieutenant-Colonels, and thus
obtaining a decided advantage over their contemporaries in
<span class="sidenote">Duke of
Richmond,
10 March,
1788.</span>
the Artillery. “This difference,” wrote the Master-General,
“and there being no rank of Major, is, I admit, an advantage
in point of rank in favour of the Engineers. The
reason of the rank of Major being suppressed in the Corps
of Engineers was that there were no troops belonging to
them to be commanded in Battalions, and therefore there
could be no use for an officer of that description.” In the
year 1827, the rank of Regimental Major was abolished in
the Royal Artillery, its holders being made Lieutenant-Colonels,
but with Majors’ pay; and in the year 1872, the
rank of Major was substituted for that of First Captain, on
account of the responsibility attached to the command of
a Battery of Artillery.</p>

<p>It was during this period that a blow was struck at the
custom, which had hitherto prevailed, of buying and selling
the appointments of Adjutant and Quartermaster. On the
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Miller,
Pamph.,
1868.</span>
24th February, 1783, the Master-General ordered that no
such appointment should in future be sold, with this exception,
that any officer who then held an appointment which
he had obtained by purchase would be allowed to sell it
when he relinquished it, but must accept 100<i>l</i>. less than he
gave for it; and that his successor must also sell for 100<i>l</i>.
less than that purchase-money; and so on until the price
should be extinguished. It was ruled, at the same time,
that a Captain-Lieutenant, holding an Adjutancy, should
vacate it on being promoted to a Company; and that as
soon as any “warrant” of a Quartermaster should become
vacant without purchase, “some meritorious non-commissioned
officer should be recommended for the same.”</p>

<p>A privilege which the Regiment had hitherto enjoyed was
abolished, and with good reason, in 1785. Prior to that
date no charge was ever made for the subsistence of either
officers or men of the Royal Artillery when being conveyed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
by transports to foreign stations, an exemption which was
not accorded to the rest of the army. Doubtless the custom
arose from the fact that the Board of Ordnance, which in
one capacity governed the Artillery, in another capacity
hired the transports; but the case had only to be stated to
ensure remedy. On the 27th August, 1785, it was ruled
that a “stoppage of 3<i>d.</i> per diem (being the same as is made
from the rest of His Majesty’s troops) be made from <i>the
officers</i>, non-commissioned officers, and privates of the
Royal Artillery during the time they shall be on board
ship.” Doubtless, the same individuals would be glad if,
in the year of grace 1873, they could travel on board ship at
the rate of 3<i>d.</i> per diem.</p>

<p>Perhaps of all the letters which the student finds in the
official correspondence of the period, the following is the
most amusing. It ought already to have been mentioned
that when the Captain of a Company retired on his pay,
awaiting a vacancy in the Invalid Battalion, his Captain-Lieutenant
received certain allowances connected with the
command of the Company. Apparently, the regulations were
not very clear on the subject; or, as is very probable,
decisions had been given in individual cases, which had not
been promulgated to the Regiment&mdash;a pernicious custom
which existed in the 18th century, and even since. A
Captain William Houghton had retired in this way; and
from his retirement the following cry of agony reached the
<span class="sidenote">2 April,
1789.</span>
Commandant of his Battalion:&mdash;“Ever since the day your
goodness was made known to the Regiment in getting me
leave of absence to retire from duty till provided with an
Invalid Company, I have never had a moment’s peace with
my Captains-Lieutenant. Their first claim was for <i>one</i>
non-effective&mdash;I gave it; the next was for both&mdash;I gave
them; and was then told they had a right to the 6<i>l.</i>
per annum allowed for stationery&mdash;this I gave up also.
They have now demanded my share of the stock purse,
and the 20<i>l.</i> per annum granted by His Majesty’s warrant,
27th July, 1772, to the Captains of Artillery, on account
of the slowness of promotion in the Regiment. Had I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
known these were to be the hard conditions of a little rest
before death, it would have been all fair; but in that case
I certainly should have remained with my Company, provided
I had done duty upon crutches.”</p>

<p>Only one point remains now to be mentioned before turning
to the causes which led to sudden augmentations in the
Regiment, combined with the commencement of hostilities.
On the 26th August, 1792, volunteers were called for from
the Companies at Woolwich, to form part of a guard ordered
to attend His Excellency Viscount Macartney, who had been
appointed Ambassador to the Court of the Emperor of
China, and also to act as instructors in gunnery to the
troops of that potentate. The strength of the party was
as follows:&mdash;One sergeant, 3 corporals or bombardiers, 1
drummer, and 15 gunners, under the command of Lieutenant
Parish. An advance was made to the detachment of a year’s
subsistence to purchase necessaries, and a second suit of
clothing was given to the non-commissioned officers and
men.</p>

<p>It has been difficult to confine this chapter to these purely
domestic, although necessary, details, because, after 1787,
the whole firmament of history has been lurid with the
events in France, which were ripening into a state of things
such as has never been seen before, or since. In 1792 it
became apparent that war between England and France was
inevitable. Recruiting had been brisk since 1787; in 1790
a free pardon had been offered to all deserters, who should
return to their Regiments; in the first month of 1793 an
augmentation to the Artillery was authorized, which will
form the subject of the next chapter; and in October 1793,
the following increase to the establishment was ordered,
viz.<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Every officer, without exception, had been ordered to join in
1792; and, although it was not until the beginning of 1793
that the French Ambassador was dismissed from the Court
of St. James’s, it was evident that a sufficient <i>casus belli</i> had
been found in the operations of the French army in the Low
Countries, and the menace to England implied in France
obtaining the control of the River Scheldt.</p>

<p>A sufficient <i>casus belli</i>, it has been said; but the student of
history must indeed be blind who fails to see that this was
but a secondary reason. A panic had seized upon the most
stable European governments, a dread lest the revolutionary
principles which animated the French people should spread
beyond the confines of France. Nor was their fear without
reason. Even England had been penetrated by Republicanism;
societies were formed, ostensibly for Parliamentary Reform,
and under the title of <i>Friends of the People</i>, which desired
undoubtedly the overthrow of the monarchy. An Englishman,
the author of ‘The Rights of Man,’ had been elected a
member of the Assembly in Paris, on account of his advanced
political opinions; and, after his trial for sedition in England,
an English mob showed their sympathy by taking the
horses out of his advocate’s carriage, and drawing it themselves
to his residence. That unfailing barometer of political
disturbance&mdash;the funds&mdash;told also a tale of great uneasiness.
<span class="sidenote">‘Annual
Register,’
1792.</span>
The Three per Cents., which stood in January 1792 at
93⅜, fell before December in the same year to 74; and all
other Government securities were at a corresponding discount.</p>

<p>The state of France was, indeed, enough to appal the
most indifferent. In the powerful language of the chronicler
of the French Revolution, France, roused by many causes,
<span class="sidenote">Carlyle.</span>
faced the world “in that terrible strength of Nature which
no man has measured;” and “whatever was cruel in the
panic-frenzy of twenty-five million men&mdash;whatsoever was
great in the simultaneous death-defiance of twenty-five
million men&mdash;stood there in abrupt contrast, near by one
another.” France was now “seeking its wild way through
the New, Chaotic&mdash;where Force is not yet distinguished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
into Bidden and Forbidden&mdash;but Crime and Virtue welter
unseparated, in that domain of what is called the Passions.” ...
“The Gospel of Man’s Rights was preached abroad with
the fearfullest Devil’s Message of man’s weaknesses and
sins;” and a whole nation was drunk with revenge, and
terror, and blood.</p>

<p>Penetrating with different effect into every class of men
in England, the tale of the French Revolution penetrated
even the recesses of the Ordnance. Raising their eyes from
ledgers, and gazing across the Channel, even the members of
the Honourable Board were moved; and on the first day of
the New Year they resolved on a step, which should bring
Field Artillery more into accord with the era in the history
of war which was now to commence. Nor was it an hour
too soon; for in three weeks’ time, on the 21st January,
<span class="sidenote">Carlyle.</span>
1793, “there was in the streets of Paris a silence as of the
grave&mdash;eighty thousand armed men stood ranked, like
armed statues of men; cannons bristled, cannoneers with
match burning, but no word or movement; it was as a
city enchanted into silence and stone: one carriage, with
its escort, slowly rumbling towards the Place de la
Révolution, the only sound.” The last of the dragon’s
teeth was about to be sown, and a crime to be committed
which should bind the governments of Europe together
against France, as one man: to whom France should answer,
<span class="sidenote">Danton.</span>
“The coalesced Kings threaten us: we hurl at their feet, as
the gage of battle, the Head of a King.”</p>

<p>Of a truth, the Honourable Board had not moved a day
too soon. Let us trace in our next chapter the development
of that portion of the Corps which dates its origin from that
terrible month of January 1793.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="medium smcap">The Necessity, Birth, and Progress of the Royal
Horse Artillery.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Of</span> all the so-called Battalion Records, which were kept at
the various Head-quarter offices at Woolwich up to the
year 1859, and the details of which are, at the best, of the
most scanty description, perhaps the most meagre and most
disappointing are those of the Royal Horse Artillery.</p>

<p>From the well-known <i>esprit</i> of this branch of the service,
it might have been expected that its earlier history would
have been treated almost with effusion by those in whose
custody was a book purporting to contain a record of its
services. But it may be said with truth that for one item
of information obtained from the written records of this
brilliant arm, ten have been obtained from the traditions
handed down verbally, and fondly treasured by successive
generations of officers; and even a greater part of the
required information has been obtained from works of general
military history, and from extant official letter-books.</p>

<p>The first section of these old Record Books professes to
treat of the circumstances of the original formation of the
particular part of the Regiment concerned. In the Records
of the Royal Horse Artillery this section is compressed into
two lines. “The Royal Horse Artillery was formed as an
additional corps to the Regiment of Artillery on the 1st
February, 1793.” Remarkable for its brevity, this account
of the formation of the Royal Horse Artillery is also
remarkable for its inaccuracy. It was <i>not</i> an additional
corps to the Royal Artillery, but from the very commencement
an essential, integral part of it. The Driver Corps,
formed in 1794, <i>was</i> an additional corps to the Royal
Artillery; but its officers were, until after Waterloo, drawn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
from a different source, and its men were never Artillerymen.
The Royal Horse Artillery, on the other hand, was invariably
officered by the Royal Artillery, and was recruited from its
ranks. Of the wisdom, or otherwise, of this policy, it will
be necessary to treat hereafter; but of the fact there can be
no doubt. Yet again, in the brief record quoted above, are
compressed other inaccuracies. The Horse Artillery did
not spring into existence, as a corps, on 1st February, 1793,
as the words would imply. Two troops were authorised in
January of that year, but not for twelve years of straggling
augmentations of staff-officers and troops, can it be said to
have attained its proper maturity. The earlier wars of the
French Revolution were the boyhood of the Royal Horse
Artillery, as the Peninsular campaign was its glorious manhood.
After Waterloo, until the Crimean War, its history
was a blank page.</p>

<p>It is fortunate that an officer of the Regiment has been
found, at once so capable and so patient in tracing out the
circumstances which impressed on the world the necessity
<span class="sidenote">Captain
H. W. L.
Hime,
Royal
Artillery.
Proceedings
R. A.
Institution.</span>
of this arm, as the author of the papers on ‘The Mobility
of Field Artillery, Past and Present.’ According to this
writer, England was the last among the leading nations in
Europe to adopt the use of Horse Artillery. As early as
1788, the subject had strongly attracted the attention of
the Master-General of the Ordnance; but, unfortunately, he
referred it to a committee. The period of gestation, so to
speak, in committees on military subjects is very great;
in this particular instance the winter of 1792 had arrived
without any result from their labours.</p>

<p>The introduction of Horse Artillery into the Prussian
service dates from 1759; and in 1792 this arm was introduced
into the French and Swedish armies. In other
European countries improvement had been made in Field
Artillery, without, however, adopting the system of <i>mounted
detachments</i>; but this latter is the distinctive mark of Horse
Artillery. It has been asserted, and on good authority,
that Horse Artillery was used in India prior even to its
adoption by Frederick the Great&mdash;and dating as far back as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
1756. If the existence of an Artillery without mobility was
sufficient to impress on the authorities in that country a
sense of the necessity of some improvements, the argument
was not wanting. In an engagement between the English
<span class="sidenote">‘History of
the Military
Transactions
of
the British
Nation in
Hindostan,’
vol. i.
pp. 312-368.</span>
and French troops near Trichinopoly in 1753, “the English,
<i>for more expedition</i>, marched without any field-pieces;”
and when the infantry advanced against the French in an
action fought shortly afterwards, “the <i>artillery, in the hurry,
could not keep up with the battalion</i>.” The advantage of a
more mobile artillery must certainly have been apparent
after such melancholy exhibitions.</p>

<p>It has already been mentioned in this work that rapidity
of movement, more especially under fire, was rendered
hopeless by the frequent employment of peasants to act as
drivers to the batteries. The formation of the Royal Horse
Artillery did not free the Field Batteries from this evil.
A quaint circumstance in proof of this is narrated by the
<span class="sidenote">Hime.</span>
author already mentioned. “In 1798, the Commandant of
Woolwich inspected some guns manned by gunners of the
8th Battalion, R.A. The guns were each drawn by three
horses in single file, which were driven by contract drivers
on foot, hired for the occasion, dressed in white smocks
<span class="sidenote">‘Aide-Mémoire
to
the Military
Sciences,’
art.
‘Ordnance.’</span>
with blue collars and cuffs, and armed with long carter’s
whips of the ordinary farm pattern. When this formidable
array had been reviewed, the Commandant, General
Lloyd, and the Garrison Adjutant, expressed their joint
opinion that field artillery movements could not be performed
quicker.” The increase of mobility over that old
system&mdash;of which the above is a real, although, perhaps,
exceptional illustration&mdash;which followed the introduction of
Horse Artillery can best be shown by another and later
instance. At the battle of Fuentes d’Onor, Bull’s troop of
Horse Artillery&mdash;now D Battery, B Brigade&mdash;was surrounded
and cut off by the French cavalry. It was at the time
under the command of the 2nd Captain, Norman Ramsay.
<span class="sidenote">Gleig.</span>
“Guns thus dealt with are almost always lost, and consequently
the army ceased to think of Ramsay and his
men, except as prisoners. Presently, however, a great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
commotion was observed among the French squadrons;
men and officers closed in confusion towards one point,
where a thick dust was rising, and where loud cries and
the sparkling of blades and flashing of pistols indicated
<span class="sidenote">Napier.</span>
some extraordinary occurrence.... Suddenly the multitude
became violently agitated; an English shout pealed
high and clear; the mass was rent asunder, and Norman
Ramsay burst forth, sword in hand, at the head of his
troop, his horses, breathing fire, stretched like greyhounds
along the plain; the guns bounded behind them
like things of no weight, and the mounted gunners followed
close, with heads bent low, and pointed weapons, in
desperate career.” Between the crawling peasant-driven
team on Woolwich parade, and this glowing description of
a Horse Artillery battery but a very few years later, there
is a contrast, which shows at a glance the immense stride
in the direction of mobility, which had followed the introduction
of that branch of the Regiment to whose story this
chapter is devoted. Much of this improvement was due to
the fostering care of the Master-General, and of the Deputy-Adjutant-General,
afterwards Sir John Macleod; much also
was due to the encouragement of General Officers, who found
to their amazement a force of Artillery, which could conform
to their most rapid movements; and not a little was due to
the practical school of experience opened in the Peninsula;
but, to their honour be it stated, the rapid progress towards
the standard of perfection attained by the Royal Horse
Artillery was mainly due to the labours, the devotion, of the
officers belonging to it, who were inspired by the same
<i>esprit</i> and the same conscientious regard for their duties, as
have continued to animate the officers of that brilliant arm
to this day.</p>

<p>While the Committee, appointed to decide the question of
Horse Artillery in connection with our service, was&mdash;according
to wont&mdash;babbling harmlessly and fruitlessly in
the fourth year of its existence, a virtual rupture took place
between England and France. The Duke of Richmond,
then Master-General, immediately took the matter himself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
in hand; and of three schemes, very dissimilar, over which
the Committee had been debating, he selected the following,
as the basis of the organization of a troop of Royal Horse
Artillery.</p>

<p>The formation of the first two troops, A and B, took
place at Woolwich, having been ordered in January 1793.
The Captains were R. Lawson, afterwards so distinguished in
Egypt, and the Brigade-Major of the Regiment, J. Macleod,
afterwards Deputy-Adjutant-General. In these&mdash;as in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
other troops subsequently formed&mdash;great care was taken to
appoint none but officers of well-known ability. This fact,
combined with the permission given to the Horse Artillery
to select the best recruits joining the Regiment, had the
immediate effect of causing the new branch to be looked on
as a <i>corps d’élite</i>: as, indeed, was the case in every other
country in Europe, except Austria. Whether this has proved
a benefit, or otherwise, to the corps, will hereafter be considered.
The <i>esprit</i> generally to be found in a <i>corps d’élite</i>
was fanned by other, minor, considerations. It must be
remembered that the gunners of Field Artillery, other than
Horse Artillery, and of Garrison Artillery, were, and still are,
interchangeable. But in the Horse Artillery “the men were
magnificently dressed, they were amply paid, and they
were not haunted by the constant dread of being suddenly
and forcibly torn from the Field Artillery service, which
they loved, and thrust into the Garrison Artillery service,
<span class="sidenote">Hime.</span>
which was strange to them.” Only 4 guns per troop were
granted at first; and the establishment consisted, in addition
to the officers, of 8 non-commissioned officers, 49 gunners,
<span class="sidenote">R. H. A.
Records.</span>
and 35 drivers. On the formation of C and D Troops, on
1st November, 1793, the armament of each troop was raised
to 6 guns, and the establishment per troop was 14 non-commissioned
officers, 85 gunners, 45 drivers, and 187 horses.</p>

<p>The officers appointed to command the new troops were,
E. Howorth, afterwards Sir E. Howorth, who subsequently
commanded the Artillery at Talavera, Busaco, and Fuentes
d’Onor, and J. M. Hadden, who afterwards became Surveyor-General
of the Ordnance. The reader will continue to
observe the selection always made of able officers to command
the troops of Horse Artillery. In 1794, E and F Troops
were formed, and the command given respectively to Captain
W. Cuppage, an officer who afterwards held for twenty-six
years the appointment of Inspector of the Royal Carriage
Department, and to Captain J. Butler, an officer who afterwards
became Lieutenant-Governor of the Royal Military
College at Sandhurst.</p>

<p>In 1794, the number of guns per troop was augmented to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
8; and this remained the establishment until 1804, in which
year the number was reduced to 6; at which it continued
until the reductions after the battle of Waterloo. In 1794,
when the number of guns was raised to 8, the following
was the establishment: 15 non-commissioned officers, 97
gunners, 71 drivers, 246 horses per troop. This was reduced
in the following year very considerably, and became 15 non-commissioned
officers, 85 gunners, 51 drivers, and 170 horses.</p>

<p>The next variation in the establishment was caused by the
formation, in Ireland, of G Troop, from detachments serving
in that country. The command of the new troop was given
to Captain&mdash;afterwards Sir&mdash;G. B. Fisher, an officer who in
1827 was appointed Commandant of Woolwich. For two years
after the formation of G Troop, the establishment of the
troops was as follows: 8 guns, 16 non-commissioned officers,
96 gunners, 58 drivers, and 190 horses. An augmentation
of 1 non-commissioned officer and 1 gunner per troop took
place in 1803.</p>

<p>In 1804, the number of guns per troop having being reduced
to 6, H Troop was formed at Woolwich, and the command
given to Captain A. Macdonald, a smart officer, who
subsequently had the good fortune to command the Horse
Artillery of the Cavalry Division at Waterloo. On the reduction
to 6 guns, the strength of each troop was, 14 non-commissioned
officers, 75 gunners, 46 drivers, and 142 horses.</p>

<p>In 1805, an augmentation of four troops took place&mdash;I, K,
L, and M; and the commands were given respectively to
Captain W. Millar, an officer who subsequently became Inspector
of Artillery, and Director-General of the Field Train
Department; to Captain C. Godfrey, an officer who went on
half-pay a few years later, in 1811; to Captain N. Foy, who
died in 1817; and to Captain the Hon. W. H. Gardner, who
died as a Colonel-Commandant in 1856.</p>

<p>For the few years following this augmentation, the establishment
remained virtually the same; but, in January
1813, 194 officers, non-commissioned officers, and men were
added to act as Rocket Detachments, and also as a depôt to
supply the troops on service. A depôt for the Royal Horse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
Artillery has existed under various names, and in somewhat
chequered circumstances. It commenced&mdash;as stated above&mdash;in
1813; it existed for many years in the form of an
Adjutant’s Detachment at Woolwich; in 1859 it was transferred
to Canterbury; on a somewhat larger scale it was
transferred to Maidstone after the amalgamation of the Royal
and Indian Artilleries; for a short time subsequently, the
Horse Artillery Batteries at home acted as a depôt for those
serving abroad; and, at the date of the publication of this
work, the last-mentioned arrangement is supplemented by
the existence of two Horse Artillery Batteries in the general
depôt for the Regiment.</p>

<p>In 1814, the various Rocket Detachments were combined,
those at home becoming the 1st, and those abroad the 2nd,
Rocket Troop. The officers appointed to command these
were Captain W. G. Elliott, an officer who retired from the
Regiment in 1828, and Captain&mdash;afterwards Sir&mdash;E. C. Whinyates,
an officer whose ability, zeal, and services have hardly
been surpassed in the Regiment. He ultimately&mdash;after a
long and active career&mdash;became Commandant of Woolwich,
where his kindly manners were long remembered. He commanded
the Rocket Troop at Waterloo, where he was severely
wounded.</p>

<p>Among the many heart-breaking reductions which exasperate
the Artillery student, perhaps none are more distressing,
than the reduction of the 2nd Rocket Troop in 1816.
<i>The 1st Rocket Troop had never been out of England</i>; the 2nd
had done good service at Leipsic and Waterloo. Neither of
them had had a long existence; but one had had a stirring,
glorious history. On the 16th May, 1815, the following
order had been issued:&mdash;“His Royal Highness the Prince
Regent, in the name and on the behalf of His Majesty, has
been pleased to command that <i>the Rocket Troop of Royal
Artillery, which was present at the Battle of Leipsic</i>, be permitted
to wear the word ‘Leipsic’ on their appointments,
in commemoration of their services on that occasion.” And
to the same troop the reward fell, given to those who had been
at the Battle of Waterloo. Yet, when the pruning-knife came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
to be used, the troop which had earned these honours was
selected for reduction; and, as if adding insult to injury,
the word ‘Leipsic’ came actually to be worn by the surviving
troop, which had never been on active service at all!
On its reduction, the officers of the 2nd Rocket Troop were
transferred to the Corps of Royal Artillery Drivers.</p>

<p>Up to this point, we have traced the growth, <i>numerically</i>,
of the Royal Horse Artillery. The conclusion of hostilities
after Waterloo led to very extensive reductions. In 1816,
besides the 2nd Rocket Troop, D, K, L, and M Troops were
<span class="sidenote"><i>Vide</i> vol. i.
p. 394.</span>
reduced, with the consequent changes of designation in the
surviving troops. From a total, of all ranks, amounting to
2675, in 1815, and 2621 horses, the Horse Artillery fell in
1816 to 1181 men and 959 horses. Of the six troops in
France with the Army of Occupation, the following was the
establishment per troop, each troop having 6 guns<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>5 officers, 14 non-commissioned officers, 85 gunners, 56
drivers, 168 horses.</p>

<p>The troops on home service were allowed only 4 guns, and
an establishment of 5 officers, 11 non-commissioned officers,
56 gunners, 24 drivers, 102 horses.</p>

<p>But this was merely a beginning. In 1819, B and G
Troops were reduced; the troops in France were brought
on the Home Establishment, and the number of guns per
troop reduced to 2. The strength was then 5 officers, 10
non-commissioned officers, 47 gunners, 18 drivers, 36 horses,
per troop; and the total strength of the Royal Horse Artillery
did not exceed 616 of all ranks, and 317 horses.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>At this miserable establishment the troops remained for
some years. In 1828, the two troops on service in Ireland
were raised to 4 guns, and remained so; the relieving troops
taking over 2 guns, and a suitable proportion of men, from
those they relieved. In 1848, <i>all</i> the troops were raised to
4 guns, with the required increase of men and horses; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
this lasted until 1852, when each troop was raised to 6 guns,
the present establishment.</p>

<p>In 1847, the Rocket Troop became I Troop: and rocket
carriages were added to the equipment of the whole.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Communicated
by
Sir D. E.
Wood.</div>

<p>The 4-gun Troops in Ireland had 2 ammunition waggons,
1 forge and 1 store waggon. On the augmentation to 6
guns in 1852, there were allowed to each troop 6 waggons,
1 forge and 1 store waggon, and 1 captain’s cart.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir E. C.
Warde.</div>

<p>The augmentations after 1847 were due to “the foresight
and determination of Lord Hardinge, who was one of the
best friends the Corps ever had, being utterly without
<span class="sidenote">Reports to
House of
Commons,
and to Lord
Panmure,
by Sir R.
Gardiner,
in 1848,
1849, and
1856.</span>
jealousy, and fully appreciating the value of an efficient,
and of sufficient, artillery.” But he was warmly aided by
one within the Corps, whose motives were as single as his
arguments were sound, whose voice was ever ready to plead
for the corps in which he had spent a long, pure, and illustrious
life, Sir Robert Gardiner. Owing to these augmentations,
42 guns of Horse Artillery were available for service
<span class="sidenote">R. H. A.
Records.</span>
in the field in 1854: and the total strength of the Brigade
stood at 1175 of all ranks, and 1054 horses.</p>

<p>Of the troops which had been reduced after Waterloo, B was
reformed as a reserve half troop in 1855, and completed in the
following year: and G and K Troops were reformed in 1857.</p>

<p>The highest point reached between the reductions after
Waterloo, and the year 1857, was in February 1856, when
the total of all ranks reached 1950, and the number of horses
was 1370. The amalgamation of the Royal with the Indian
Artilleries brought the strength of Royal Horse Artillery
available for service to an unprecedented standard: at the
present moment there are in the regiment thirty-one <i>service</i>
and two <i>depôt</i> Horse Artillery Batteries. But this chapter
relates solely to the <i>old</i> Royal Horse Artillery.</p>

<p>As yet the <i>numerical</i> variations in the Royal Horse Artillery
have alone been treated. But there are many other
details, mainly of interior economy, which will doubtless be
interesting to the modern representatives of the arm, and
which may here be briefly stated.

<p>At first, it was directed that recruits might be taken who
were 5 feet 6¾ inches in height: but before six months had
passed, the standard was raised, at the urgent request of the
Captains, to 5 feet 8 inches. There was often difficulty in
obtaining a sufficient number of suitable recruits, and even
when the troops were complete, it was customary to attach
to each, when in the field, a few of the Driver Corps, with
<span class="sidenote">Lefroy.</span>
additional horses or mules. Extra pay was granted from
the first to the officers, non-commissioned officers, and
gunners of Horse Artillery.</p>

<p>The exact relative <i>status</i> of the new branch of the service
was speedily settled. On 21st February, 1797, the Board of
Ordnance granted the same allowance for forage to the officers,
as was allowed to officers of Cavalry; and so early had
it been decided that the Horse Artillery should take the
right of all Cavalry, that, as will be seen by the following
letter, the Master-General would not in 1804 allow the
point to be disputed.</p>

<p>Both by custom and regulation this precedence continued
to belong to the Royal Horse Artillery until July 1869,
when it was ordered that the Household Cavalry, <i>when the
Sovereign should be present</i>, should have the precedence
awarded to a body guard.</p>

<p>It was laid down as a rule, that no officer should be appointed
to the Horse Brigade, who had not been on foreign
service: but as this rule was occasionally broken, it was
decided in July 1805 that any officers who had been appointed
to the Horse Artillery, prior to having been on
foreign service, should “(to avoid any officers being confined
to one species of duty) be liable after three or four years’
service in the Horse Brigade to be exchanged again into
the Battalions, so that they may take their share of duty on
foreign service, and obtain that experience which is necessary
to an Artillery officer, as he advances in the Regiment.”
For the information of the general reader it should here be
stated, that prior to 1861, when the amalgamation of the
Imperial and East India Company’s armies took place, the
Royal Horse Artillery never went abroad except on active
service. Since 1861, however, India has opened a field of
foreign service for this branch of the Regiment: and fifteen
batteries of service Horse Artillery are to be found in that
country, against sixteen at home.</p>

<p>The changes in the dress of the Horse Artillery may be
gathered from the following statistics. An order dated
1st November, 1806, lays down the following rules for the
dress of officers:&mdash;“Except at dress parades the blue Regimental
overalls are to be worn till dinner-time in place of
the blue pantaloons, which is to be the afternoon dress
when at home. At all parades, whether mounted or dismounted,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
and during the day, the black velvet stock is to
be worn, with an inch of shirt collar over it: no other
white to be shown. In the evenings, it is requested that
black silk handkerchiefs may be substituted with the same
proportion of shirt collar over them. When officers are
dressed for a ball, evening party, or dine out, they are to
wear the jacket open, white pantaloons, plain white waistcoat
(with sash over it), light sword, regulation sword-knot,
black belt, with cocked-hat and feather. In common
a white leather sword-knot is to be worn. Spurs with
horizontal rowels to be worn at all times.”</p>

<p>Prior to 1812, gaiters and knee-boots had been worn: but
on the 14th January in that year his Royal Highness the
Prince Regent issued the following order<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The officers of the Royal Horse Artillery are to wear
jackets similar to the private men, with an aiguillette. In
parade dress, they are to wear white leather pantaloons,
and Hussar boots, with gold binding. On ordinary duties
or on march, they are to wear overalls of a colour similar
to the private men’s, and a short <i>surtout</i>, which is calculated
to be worn likewise as a <i>pelisse</i> on service. When attending
a drawing-room or levee, they may appear in long
coats, with lappels and aiguillettes, the same as are worn
with the jacket, but without lace on the seams: or in the
Regimental jacket, as they may prefer. The officers of the
Horse Artillery are likewise to wear cocked-hats, with
the star loop, with their <i>dress</i> regimentals.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1823.</div>

<p>By General Order of 5th August, 1823, leather pantaloons
and Hessian boots were abolished, blue-grey overalls and
Wellington boots being substituted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1827.</div>

<p>By General Order of 22nd December, 1827, helmets were

from 12 to 8 inches.</p>

the undress frock-coat and red embroidered waistcoat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1857.</div>

<p>In this year booted leather overalls were instituted; and
swan-neck steel spurs for all ranks were substituted for the
brass spurs of the officers, and the straight steel spurs of the

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A more important thing, however, than the dress has been
the armament of the Royal Horse Artillery. Its greatest
deeds have been wrought with the 6-pounder; but that was
not its invariable weapon. Talking merely of the pre-amalgamation
days<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>&mdash;the days which belong to <i>history</i> instead of
<i>to-day</i>, when rifled ordnance was unknown in Horse Artillery&mdash;there
were even then not unfrequent changes of armament.
One troop, as we shall see hereafter, went on service with
12-pounders; on the eve of Waterloo, owing to the want of
guns of position, three troops received 9-pounders, instead
of the 6-pounders which they had brought from England;
and coming to later days, at the commencement of the
Crimean War, the two troops, C and I, which first left
England were armed with 6-pounders; but, on reaching
Varna, C Troop was ordered to exchange them for 9-pounders;
and I Troop would have been left behind, for inability to do
the same, had it not been that Lord Raglan yielded to the
urgent entreaties of its commander, Colonel Maude, to allow
it to accompany the expedition.</p>

<p>During the Peninsular Campaign, the armament of a troop
was as follows:&mdash;2 9-pounders, or 2 heavy 6-pounders;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
1 heavy 5½-inch howitzer; 3 light 6-pounders; 6 ammunition
<span class="sidenote">Lefroy.</span>
waggons; 3 reserve waggons, and 4 other carriages. Compared
with the simplicity of modern Horse Artillery armament,
the presence of three different guns in the same troop,
with the consequent necessity of a variety of ammunition,
seems a very complicated and undesirable arrangement.
This was frequently felt at the time; and at the change of
armament made before Waterloo, a foreshadowing of the
modern harmony of weapons might be detected in the arming
of I Troop&mdash;Bull’s&mdash;with 5½-inch howitzers only. And right
noble was the service done by that troop on the 18th of June.</p>

<p>During the season of starvation between 1819 and 1848,
the guns attached to the skeleton troops were 6-pounders.
With the augmentations, a proportion of howitzers made its
re-appearance.</p>

<p>The proper armament for Horse Artillery, in the days
before the substitution of rifled ordnance put an end to the
discussion, was exhaustively treated by Sir Robert Gardiner.
His arguments are interesting even at the present day, when
the perfection of Field Batteries, and their ability to carry
more gunners into action by means of the new-pattern
carriage, have combined to make not a few question the
necessity of so expensive an arm as Horse Artillery being
retained. If we substitute the 9-pounder rifled gun for the
old 6-pounder, and the 16-pounder for the old 9-pounder, in
Sir Robert’s remarks, we shall find his arguments as applicable
<span class="sidenote">Report on
the Artillery
by
Sir R. Gardiner,
31 Mar.
1848.</span>
to the later as to the former controversy. “There can
be no greater mistake than to put rivalry or comparisons,
or to expect the same results from the employment of Horse
Artillery as of Brigade (i. e. Field) Artillery. Though <i>one
and the same arm</i>, they are equipped and intended for
totally distinct purposes. The necessary quick movements
of the Horse Artillery could not be attained by 9-pounders;
the telling effect of 9-pounders could not be expected from
Horse Artillery. One is intended to act with Cavalry, and,
from the nature of its equipment and the lightness of its
metal, is expected to maintain at all times, and under all
circumstances, of bad roads, of rough, hilly, or broken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
ground, the same pace as Cavalry; and, in short, to bring
artillery into action wherever Cavalry can act....
I can name two instances in which, while acting with
cavalry, any other than Horse Artillery would have been
perfectly useless. One, the affair of Morales, in Spain;
the other, the movement from Quatre Bras to the position
of Waterloo. Both were specially movements of Horse
Artillery, and both tried the wind and speed of our horses.
In the latter movement particularly, through a deep cross
country, any Artillery differently equipped would have
inevitably fallen into the hands of the enemy. In all light
movements of the Infantry of an army, Horse Artillery is
as indispensably necessary and as exclusively effective, as
it is with cavalry. I have myself, in cases of reconnoissance,
been withdrawn from the Cavalry for the moment,
to cover movements in which heavier Artillery could bear
no part.... On the other hand, if Horse Artillery
has its distinct advantages over heavier guns, so likewise
the latter have their distinct purposes, for which the
employment of Horse Artillery would be wholly inapplicable
and inadequate.... I have known Brigade
Artillery as perfect, in its way, as Horse Artillery;
but no more comparison can be drawn between them than
between Cavalry and Infantry.”</p>

<p>Then follows a remark, which shows how the writer anticipated
the changes which have come, and which have done
so much to improve our Field Artillery: “Our present
Brigades would be greatly advanced in efficiency if, like
the Horse Artillery, or the Brigades with the Duke of
Wellington’s army in the Peninsula, they were placed
under the command and the responsibility of their captains.
They should also, to become effective Field Artillery, be
placed on the same footing as the Horse Artillery, for their
contingent share in all garrison and general duties. They
should march to and from the outposts in relief in the same
manner as the Horse Artillery; they should combine, like
the Horse Artillery, the knowledge of the duties of Cavalry
with those of Artillery. They would thus gradually attain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
that perfection in their own distinctive service, which I
believe to be unequalled in the few skeleton troops we
possess of Horse Artillery.”</p>

<p>At the time these words were penned, Field Artillery had
reached a point of degradation which had hardly been surpassed
even in the old days of peasant drivers. Of the six
batteries or brigades nominally at Woolwich, two existed on
<span class="sidenote">Sir R. Gardiner’s
Report.</span>
paper, having neither men nor horses. “Two others,” wrote
Sir R. Gardiner, “are so little advanced in their necessary
drill and training as to be quite non-effective for the purposes
of service, or even the common movements of parade
and review. Two only might possibly move without causing
interruption or confusion to other troops they might be
acting with; but that is as much as can be said of them....
The riding and driving of our Brigade drivers
is at this moment very bad. With the exception of the
Brigades stationed in Dublin, where they have occasional
opportunities of moving with other troops, they are unskilful,
and ignorant of Artillery movements; at Woolwich
they are employed in <i>carter’s work</i> in the civil departments
of the Arsenal; and, of course, as long as such a system is
pursued they can never become Artillery drivers....
The Brigades in Ireland are more efficient, and fitted to
move with other troops, than the Brigades in England.
But it is a delusion to say that England has a Field
Artillery. There is not a single 9-pounder horsed in the
British service&mdash;an astounding fact. Nor will it be believed,
except by those who know the truth, that the English
army has been for years without Artillery attached either
to Cavalry or Infantry, for the common purposes of drill
and exercise in their combined movements.”</p>

<p>The progress of Field Artillery to its present excellence
may be said to date from 1848. Already, before 1856, the
Light Field Artillery had regained what it had lost during
the economical era which followed Waterloo; and since 1859,
when the new brigade system put an end to the incessant
change of batteries from field to garrison service, the progress
has been continuous. But this progress would have
been impossible had it not been that a standard of Field
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
Artillery excellence had been maintained, even under the
most adverse and depressing circumstances, by those unequalled
skeleton troops of Horse Artillery, whose officers
have, by their influence and exertions, done so much to make
what may be called <i>medium</i> Field Artillery the admirable
service which it now is. It has been said that the influence
of the Horse Artillery, during the period between 1816 and
1848, was injurious to the Field Batteries. If it were so, it
was in the most indirect manner possible. Economy in our
military administration being peremptorily demanded, the
only alternative left to the Board of Ordnance was between
a very small force of admirable Field Artillery, and a larger
force of batteries starved in equipment and incapable of
service in the field. The officers of the Regiment, whose
position entitled them to be the advisers of the Board, were
undoubtedly men whose sympathies lay with the Horse
Artillery, in which they had all served; but they were also
men who had seen, during the campaigns in the Peninsula,
Belgium, and France, what was possible with a well-equipped
Field Artillery of less mobility. In deciding on a small but
perfect force, rather than a larger and indifferent one, it
must be admitted that they acted wisely. The brilliant
Field Artillery of the great war would have otherwise become
a mere tradition, whereas, under the system adopted,
it remained a reality, a model, and a standard. The adoption
of the other alternative would have vitally injured the
Horse, without much benefit to the Field Artillery; and it
would have rendered the reorganisation of both a more difficult,
and a more tardy operation. That the Field Artillery
suffered terribly during the period mentioned, is too true;
but dispassionate study of the Regimental history proves, not
what has often been asserted, that the suffering was due to the
blighting influence of a <i>corps d’élite</i> but merely to an unwise,
an unprofitable, and a singularly short-sighted economy.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>A much larger question arises when the policy of a <i>corps
d’élite</i>, as a part of a larger body on which it feeds, has to be
considered. No subject has been so fruitful of discussion in
the Regiment; and nowhere can a decision be more safely
arrived at than in a careful study of the Regimental history.
There are strong arguments in favour of, and also against, the
policy which has existed since the formation of the Royal
Horse Artillery; and the best way of arriving at a conclusion
is to state these arguments, and to weigh their
respective values.</p>

<p>It has been said that the existence of a <i>corps d’élite</i> produces
<span class="sidenote">Trochu.</span>
“I’énervation de la masse au profit des groupes.” In
<span class="sidenote">Hime.</span>
stronger language it has also been said: “The more ruthlessly
the system of selection is carried out, the more
rapidly do the troops from amongst whom the selection is
made lose their self-respect and become at first apathetic,
and at last inefficient. The <i>corps d’élite</i>, the insatiable
parasite, must degenerate in precisely the same degree as
the body which feeds it; and the end is, that in the lapse
of a few years the whole edifice crumbles, totters, and
falls. When the oak falls, the ivy that killed it must
fall too.”</p>

<p>But those who apply such language to the existence, in
the Royal Artillery, of a <i>corps d’élite</i> such as the Royal Horse
Artillery, forget several important considerations which distinguish
it from such a corps as the French <i>Chasseurs à pied</i>,
of which it was said that everything that was good, everything
that was efficient, everything that was soldierlike in
the Infantry of the Line was seized upon with unsparing
hands, and remorselessly drafted into it. In the first place,
the selection for this branch of the Regiment is only made
for the purpose of officering it. The field battery which
rejoices in smart non-commissioned officers and men is in no
dread of losing them to feed a favoured corps. From the
day a recruit joins the Horse Artillery, his efficiency and his
education depend on the officers of that arm; and therefore
to them is the credit due if their efforts are successful.</p>

<p>There have been occasions when the Horse Artillery was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
permitted to select from the recruits of the other battalions;
but these days have passed away. No service battery of
Field or Garrison Artillery has to minister to the wants of
our <i>corps d’élite</i>, and therefore the language employed in
<span class="sidenote">Hime.</span>
another place by the able author quoted above, in reference
to the <i>Infantry corps d’élite</i> in our service, is more applicable
than that used by him in reference to our Field Artillery:
“The recruits are selected with care; but they are selected
from society at large, not from regiments of the Line; and
the result is that this noble body of men, the Guards, are
a source of wholesome emulation, instead of contentious
rivalry, to the rest of the army.”</p>

<p>The whole question, therefore, may be condensed into one
point&mdash;the wisdom or otherwise of <i>officering</i> the Horse
Artillery from the Regiment at large. Such petty considerations
as higher pay, special privileges, &amp;c., which are
apt to embitter the minds of some, must be put aside as
unworthy. In a question affecting not merely the Regiment,
but our whole military life as well, we cannot be too careful
in clearing the ground of all but the purest argument. The
opposers of the existing system have always been able
to argue with great force, because there are undoubted
anomalies, which can easily be described in such a way as to
appear ludicrous. As selection for employment in the Horse
Brigade has always been conditional on previous zeal and
efficiency, it follows that the reward for activity and knowledge
in the performance of, it may be, Siege and Garrison
Artillery duties, is often employment in a service totally dissimilar.
This may be compared with rewarding an Infantry
officer for skill in battalion drill, by giving him a troop of
Horse! Yet, while admitting the anomaly, it is impossible
to suggest a better test, if both branches of the Regiment
are to be officered from the same list. The only test of efficiency
which can be trusted is efficiency already proved. It
must be believed that a man who has been faithful and
zealous in one line of duty will display the same zeal and
conscience in another; and if selection <i>has</i> to be made,&mdash;if
there are many candidates for any employment, their previous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
history, even under very different circumstances, is the
best witness for or against them.</p>

<p>But another argument employed against the existing
system is, that an officer, who has once served in the more
brilliant branch, returns with reluctance, on promotion, to
the others, and is restless and dissatisfied until he is reappointed.
In other words, that <i>esprit</i> for the particular
branch drowns that for the Regiment. History is the best
witness here.</p>

<p>Excluding the many living men, who have proved that
Horse Artillery service has not affected their Regimental
<i>esprit de corps</i>, let us recall the names of the men who have
been most distinguished for professional talent of every
description since the formation of the Royal Horse Artillery.
Sir John Macleod, Sir Augustus Frazer, Sir Alexander
Dickson, Sir John May, Sir Robert Gardiner, and Sir E.
C. Whinyates, all served in the Horse Artillery, but never
allowed themselves to be blinded, by their love of that service,
to the interests of the Regiment at large. Their letters,
their very lives, are witnesses to their devotion to the whole
Corps; and while serving with the Siege or Garrison
Artillery, their performance of duty was inspired by the
same zeal, as when serving in what may be called the more
attractive branch. They all saw and felt that the less
showy was the more scientific, that Garrison Artillery was
the backbone of the Regiment, and that, under favourable
circumstances, it would dwarf, even in popularity, the
mounted batteries. The Peninsular and Waterloo campaigns
were conducive to the efficiency and popularity of Horse
Artillery; but let Siege Artillery have as many years of such
service as it went through at Sebastopol, with the mounted
batteries acting merely as carriers of ammunition, and its
efficiency and popularity would be quite as great.</p>

<p>History therefore does not support the theory that service
in the Horse Brigade injures the capacity, or the <i>esprit de
corps</i>, of an officer who returns to the other branches. The
question at issue therefore condenses itself into a still narrower
field; viz., admitting that the present system does not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
prevent Artillery officers from being <i>generally</i> efficient, would
they not be much <i>more</i> efficient if they belonged to Field
or Garrison Artillery during their whole career, without the
power of interchanging their services? If ability in field
battery service were rewarded by appointment to the Horse
Artillery, and skill in Garrison Artillery service were
rewarded, either by special employment or by appointment
to some such corps as was recommended by Sir Robert
Gardiner&mdash;an Artillery of the Guard&mdash;would we not have
better officers of each branch than we now have? Logically,
there can be but one answer; and were this the only consideration,
the argument would terminate in favour of a
separation of the officers of the various arms, similar to that
already existing between the non-commissioned officers and
men. We should then have probably <i>more</i> skilled artillerists,
in point of number, in each branch; although perhaps
no <i>individual</i> more skilled than those who have appeared
under, or in spite of, the anomalous system which has
hitherto existed.</p>

<p>But would the Regiment in the end be a gainer by the
change? Has not the system of interchange been the best
school possible for familiarising the Artillery officer with the
duties and movements of other arms, and thus qualifying
him for commands in the field? General Foy, in writing
of the days when such a thing as a command being given to
<span class="sidenote">Foy.</span>
a General of Artillery was unknown, owing to jealousy of the
Ordnance, said: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“On a trop en horreur les avancements hors
de la règle pour permettre qu’un artilleur qui se trouverait
trop à l’étroit dans son arme s’élançât dans le service
général de la ligne. Jamais de l’école de Woolwich ne
sortira un Bonaparte.”</span> The days of the Ordnance have
passed away: public opinion points more surely every day to
the employment of Generals who are not merely soldiers,
but scientific soldiers as well; and it would be a suicidal
policy which would recommend a change which, if carried
out logically, would result in the <i>certainty</i> of admirable
officers of high but <i>narrow</i> professional training, and the

would qualify them for a mixed command. The Garrison
Artilleryman who in his battery had attained a skill in his
particular groove, hitherto but rare, would feel every day
his association with the other arms getting less, and his
consequent inability to command them getting greater. If
this consideration be carefully borne in mind, even those
who feel most strongly on the subject&mdash;and they are many&mdash;will
hesitate ere they precipitate a result which would
inscribe on the walls of the Academy the dismal prediction,

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The extra rate of pay to non-commissioned officers and gunners
of the Royal Horse Artillery is based on the following General Order,
dated 21 January, 1793<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The Master-General directs that an allowance of twopence per day, in
addition to their Regimental pay, shall be made to each non-commissioned
officer and gunner of the Brigade of Horse Artillery, when
and so long as he continues mounted, and having the care and management
of an horse, in consideration of the extraordinary and constant
attention required of such persons for the due performance of this particular
service, which must deprive them of the occasional advantages
arising from their being employed in works for which additional pay is
given.</p>

<p>“The dismounted non-commissioned officers and gunners of this
Brigade not being in the same circumstances, nor deprived of their share
in the works, will not be entitled to the said allowance; nor will the
drivers of this Brigade, as they are to be enlisted merely for that special
service, and will have but little of other duties to learn or perform.”</p>

<p><i>Note 2.</i>&mdash;The style of horse considered suitable for Horse Artillery at
first, may be ascertained from the following instructions, dated Woolwich,
March 1810:&mdash;“The horses to be from four to six years old (when bought),
to be short-legged, open-chested, and broad-winded; not to exceed
15 hands 2 inches, nor&mdash;four years old&mdash;under 15 hands ½ inch; to have
good bone and action, the colours to be bay, brown, and dark chestnut.”
The price allowed, after a month’s trial, was thirty guineas.</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> <i>causes</i> of a war are to a certain extent beyond the
province of a work which has mainly to deal with
<span class="sidenote">Hist. R. A.

its history. In the present instance, allusion has already
been made to the ostensible reason; but it is very difficult
<span class="sidenote">Stephen’s
‘Wars of
the French
Revolution.’</span>
to arrive at the exact truth. “From the guilt and odium
of this new and disastrous conflict the ruling parties in
both nations anxiously endeavoured to vindicate themselves.”
There is no doubt that in 1792 England
threatened to declare war, unless France should renounce
her views of aggression and aggrandisement; or, in other
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.</span>
words, “relinquish all her conquests, and confine herself
within her own territory.” The answer given by M.
Chauvelin to Lord Grenville, on the 13th January, 1793,
was: “We will fight the English, whom we esteem, with
regret; but we will fight them without fear.” Matters
were precipitated by the execution of the French King; and
on the 24th January M. Chauvelin received notice to quit
England within eight days. Once again the French attempted
to pacify the English Government, but without
success. They therefore took the initiative&mdash;declaring war,
in the name of the French Republic, against England and
Holland on the 1st February, 1793; and this was followed
on the 11th February by a counter-declaration on the part
of England.</p>

<p>On the 17th February the French army took the field, resolved
to carry the war into Holland; and speedily captured
Breda, Klundert, and Gertruydenberg. The siege of Williamstadt
was not so successful; and here good service was
rendered by the Royal Artillery on board bomb-vessels. Severe
reverses having befallen another French army, employed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
elsewhere in the Low Countries, the whole of the French
troops were withdrawn from this first expedition against
Holland. Space prevents any description of the operations
between the Imperialists and the troops of the Republic&mdash;the
losses and defeats of the latter under Dumouriez, and
his subsequent defection. The movements of the Army
under the Duke of York will be all that it is necessary to
study, to ascertain the services of the Corps in this war.</p>

<p>Although the main Artillery force for this expedition did
not embark until the 10th May, 1793, Woolwich was much
disquieted after the end of February with incessant demands
for battalion guns and the requisite detachments for the
regiments under orders for the Low Countries. In no English
war was this pernicious system of battalion guns more systematically
urged and practised.  Occasionally&mdash;as will be
seen presently&mdash;the guns were brigaded; and during the
siege operations, as at Valenciennes, the Artillery did duty
by companies: but, as a rule, the guns were attached in pairs
to the different battalions. Only one waggon accompanied
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.</span>
each pair of guns; and the following was the strength of
the Artillery detachment: viz., 1 subaltern, 2 non-commissioned
officers, 8 gunners, 3 drivers, and 9 horses. The faults
of this system have already been alluded to, but are most
<span class="sidenote">Captain
H. W. L.
Hime, R.A.,
on ‘Mobility
of
Field Artillery.’</span>
clearly shown in the following words:&mdash;“To prevent these
guns from impeding the movements of the infantry to
whom they belonged, their weight was reduced to an extent
which made their fire under the most favourable circumstances
all but useless. Secondly, as a matter of fact, they
did seriously encumber their infantry. For, infantry
compelled to drag guns along with them could not be
expected to march, even on smooth and level plains, with
the same order and rapidity as infantry who marched free
from such an encumbrance; and in a cultivated country,
intersected with ditches, hedges, and walls, the guns had to
be abandoned altogether. In this latter case they not only
failed to fulfil the very object of their existence, but left a
gap in the line which, as they were generally placed in
the centre of the battalion, might produce fatal consequences.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
Thirdly, as it was necessary for them to take
part in all the manœuvres of the battalion, the necessary
time was not afforded to the gunners for placing, loading,
or laying their guns carefully. No guns could have been
effective under this system, which violated <i>both</i> the fundamental
principles of Field Artillery tactics, viz., that the
movements of a battery in action should be minimum in
number, and should be made at a maximum speed.
Fourthly, their constant presence with their infantry led
the latter to look upon the guns as necessary to the safety
of the battalion, and thus diminished that self-confidence
which infantry must possess to be successful. Fifthly,
as these guns were practically useless, not only was the
money spent on their construction wasted, but the regular
columns or trains of Artillery were deprived of a corresponding
number of guns, which might have been turned
to good account by their own officers. In fine, this bad
system weakened the Artillery without strengthening the
Infantry, and raised a general prejudice against the use in
the field of what was regarded as a complicated and useless
mechanism.”</p>

<p>At the special request of the Duke of York, Major&mdash;afterwards
Sir William&mdash;Congreve was appointed to command
the Artillery of the expedition. He embarked in May with
the main body of his force. A party under the command of
Brevet-Major Wright left England earlier in the spring of
1793, to take part in the siege operations with which the
English share of the campaign commenced. Its strength

<p>Returning to the war, it may be observed that it was at
the blockade of Condé that the English troops first took the
field, forming part of the Allied Army under the Prince de
Cobourg. The French suffered reverses at Famars and
Quiévrain; but the first occasion on which the Artillery received
special mention was on the 8th May, 1793, at St.
Amand, when the Brigade of Guards was engaged in
support of the Prussians, and contributed greatly to the
success of the day. The Battalion guns attached to the
Guards on this occasion were of great service, succeeding in
silencing the enemy’s artillery, and so breaking his infantry
that the charge ultimately made by the Guards was doubly
effective. The wording of the letter to the Master-General,
in praise of the conduct of the Artillery on this occasion,
seems to imply that the guns were brigaded, from the fact
of Major Wright’s name being mentioned as in command<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>On this occasion the French General Dampierre was
killed by a cannon-shot from the English batteries. On
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
the following day the enemy was driven from his camp at
Famars, and Valenciennes was invested by the Allies. Condé
was taken three months after the commencement of the
blockade. Valenciennes, having been approached in a methodical
manner, according to the strictest rule, did not suffer
any serious attack until the forty-first day of the siege.
On the 25th July the outworks were taken, mainly through
the exertions and gallantry of the English under General
Abercromby; and on the following day, in answer to a
second summons, the place surrendered to the English and
their allies. The Siege Artillery used on this occasion was
considerable in quantity, and of its effect the following
extract from the Duke of York’s despatch will be the best
proof: “The batteries were allotted at different times to be
worked by the Royal Artillery, and every commendation
is due to Major Congreve and to the officers and men of
that Corps, who have upon this occasion fully supported the
reputation they have so long enjoyed.” For his services
on this occasion Major Congreve received on the 21st
August, 1793, the brevet rank of Lieutenant-Colonel.</p>

<p>One or two minor actions took place before winter put
an end to hostilities. At Lincelles, on the 18th August,
1793, the Artillery attached to the Brigade of Guards under
General Lake again did good service; and on this occasion
the first officer of the Corps who fell during the war lost
his life&mdash;Lieutenant Depeyster. The official account of this
engagement, after lauding the gallantry of the Guards,
went on to say: “Equal praise is due to Major Wright and
the officers and men of the Royal Artillery attached to the
Battalions.”</p>

<p>Ill-success followed. The siege of Dunkirk by the Duke
of York proved a failure. He was badly supported by his
allies, and received little or no assistance from the navy.
He had therefore to retreat&mdash;certainly in good order&mdash;but
leaving behind him 32 heavy guns intended for the siege.
At Lannoy, on the 28th October, Lieutenant Thornton
of the Royal Artillery, afterwards Sir Charles Thornton,
A.D.C. to King William IV., lost an arm. It was by this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
time apparent to the Allies that the war, so far as they were
concerned, must be a purely defensive one; and they found
it extremely difficult to hold Austrian Flanders. The
darkness of their situation was lit up at the end of October
by a successful attack on Marchiennes, made by General
Kray under the direction of the Duke of York, in which the
enemy lost 12 pieces of cannon, and 2000 killed and
wounded. In spite of this success, however, winter came
upon the Allies, finding them in a very different frame of
mind from that in which they had commenced the campaign.
They did not, however, despair, but resolved and prepared
to commence with greater vigour than ever the campaign of
1794.</p>

<p>Their united strength on the 16th April amounted to
187,000 men; but it was injudiciously divided into eight
columns, to march on different points; the fourth and fifth
being under the command of the Duke of York. The object
of these two columns was the attack and capture of the
village of Vaux, which they undertook, and in which they
succeeded on the 17th April, 1794. Major-General Abercromby
and Sir William Erskine commanded the columns,
and Colonel Congreve in person commanded the Royal
Artillery, whose well-directed fire on this day has been
acknowledged by all writers. The French lost 30 pieces of
Artillery. One of the companies of the Corps received on
this day an honour, unprecedented in the previous or subsequent
annals of the Regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MS. Records

<p>No. 1 Company, 4th Battalion&mdash;now No. 4 Battery, 7th

such an extent by its gallantry and skill, that he made the
whole army form up on the field of battle while this company
marched past him. He also published a General Order,
saying: “His Royal Highness desires that Captain Boag
and Lieutenant Fead of the Royal Artillery (the officers

spirited and able manner in which they conducted the
battery entrusted to their care.” If history is not utterly
powerless, the story of the 17th April ought to stir the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
hearts of this battery, and make every man in its ranks
strive to be not unworthy of those, who proved themselves
worthy of so rare and honourable a distinction. To be
singled out for bravery on a day when all were brave, and
to display a spirit and an ability which, amid all the confusion
of battle, attracted the observation of a preoccupied
commander, surely these are traditions which should fire
the most generous emotions, and awaken the most noble
resolves. It is in such a belief, and with such a hope
as this, that men have been found to record such tales in
Regimental records, and that others have been found to
transcribe them fondly from faded pages, and give to them a
new life and a wider circulation.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the success at Vaux, Landrecies was
besieged by the Allies, the English troops covering the
operations towards Cambray. Twice between the 23rd and
26th April did the Duke of York’s force defeat the French;
and on the 26th it was mainly owing to the well-directed
fire of the Royal Artillery, under Colonel Congreve, that the
French were dislodged from their position in the village of
Troisvilles, with a loss of 35 guns and 300 prisoners.
Landrecies surrendered on the 29th April; but this advantage,
even when combined with the Duke of York’s successes,
did not atone for the severe defeat, which had been experienced
on the 26th April by the Allied Army under
General Clairfayt at the hands of a French army under
General Pichegru. There seems from this time to have been
a want of harmony among the Allies. Their armies melted
away into more isolated columns every day; and the system
of incessant attack, irrespective and regardless of frequent
defeat, which was pursued by the French forces, seems to
have produced a nervous effect upon their opponents, under
which each commander seemed to play, so to speak, for his
own hand. The representatives of the old school of war
were bewildered by the activity of those of the new. They
found themselves fighting, confined by strict and wooden
rules, by which their adversaries refused to be bound; and
the consequences proved fatal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<p>The English army continued to achieve minor successes
at Lannoy, Roubaix, and Monveaux; but met with a serious
reverse on the 18th May, 1794, when Major Wright’s Battery
was nearly cut to pieces. The French succeeded in completely
surrounding the English, who had actually to effect
a retreat through the enemy’s troops, in doing which
Major Wright’s battery, now B Battery, 1st Brigade, Royal
Artillery, was charged by the French cavalry, and suffered
the loss of its commander, 5 men and 31 horses killed, and
2 subalterns, Lieutenants Boger and Downman, 45 men,
and 70 horses wounded. In fact, the battery was placed
completely <i>hors de combat</i>, as might have been expected
when guns were so hampered as to allow a charge of cavalry
to be possible. Surrounded as they were on all sides by
mingled friends and foes, it was impossible to come into
action on the advancing hussars; and the many acts of
individual bravery failed to save them from virtual annihilation.</p>

<p>Fortune was more favourable a few days later&mdash;on the
22nd May&mdash;when the English successfully resisted a general
attack of the French under General Pichegru; and their
obstinacy on this occasion was the origin of the barbarous
order issued by the ruffians who held the reins of government
in Paris, forbidding any quarter to be given “to the slaves
of King George.” This was nobly answered by the Duke
of York, who in a General Order, dated 7th June, 1794,
urged his troops to “suspend their indignation, and to
remember that mercy to the vanquished is the brightest
<span class="sidenote">Gen. Order.</span>
gem in a soldier’s character.” In the repulse of the enemy
on the 22nd May the conduct of the Artillery was such that
“His Royal Highness the commander-in-chief begged to
thank Captain Trotter, with the Artillery under his
command, for their great display of intrepidity and good
conduct, which reflected the greatest honour on themselves,
and at the same time was highly instrumental in deciding
the important victories of the 22nd.”</p>

<p>From this time, however, the Allies experienced nothing
but disaster. The capture of Charleroi and the battle of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
Fleurus proved the increasing merits of the French army,
while the welcome from the Belgian cities, which one after
another, including Brussels itself, fell into the hands of the
French, proved that the sympathy of the people was much
more with them than with the Allies. It is difficult to
overrate the value of such sympathy in war.</p>

<p>In the course of these disasters the Duke of York’s communications
with Ostend were interrupted, and the English
Government, becoming seriously alarmed, fitted out the
expedition already referred to, which left Southampton for
the Continent, under the command of Lord Moira. After
many vicissitudes this second army succeeded in effecting a
junction with the Duke of York, after defeating the French
at Alost and Malines. The continued advance and repeated
attacks made by the French army, compelled the Duke to
retire across the Meuse into Holland. The surrender of
the frontier fortresses followed; and then, while other
French armies were detailed to pursue the Continental part
of the Allied forces, Pichegru himself, with a much larger
force than that under the command of the Duke of York,
resolved to invade Holland, and exterminate the English.
From this moment the Duke, being completely outnumbered,
was compelled steadily to retire. An action took place on
the 15th September, between his advanced guard and the
French troops, at Boxtel, the result of which was a further
retreat, and the abandonment to their own resources of
Bois-le-duc, Breda, and Bergen-op-Zoom. The first-named
of these places was invested by the French on the 23rd
September, 1794, and surrendered on the 10th October.
Without waiting to take the other two, and leaving them in
his rear, Pichegru, with the energy which characterised the
French armies of the Revolution, and with a contempt for
the laws of war which paralyzed his opponents, pushed on
in pursuit of the English, whose retreat in face of superior
numbers was&mdash;it must be confessed by every one&mdash;very
skilfully managed. The Duke of York was in position at
Pufflech when the French came up, and on the 19th October,
1794, a severe engagement took place, which ended in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
English army being compelled to retire behind the Waal,
while the French undertook the siege of various garrisons.
On the 28th October, Venloo was taken; followed, on the
5th November, by the capture of Maestricht; and on the
same day the siege of Nimeguen was commenced. Here
gallant service was rendered by the English, and, among
others, General Abercromby was wounded; but the
impetuosity of the French was such that the Duke of York,
finding his intercourse with the garrison cut off, retired a
little farther to take up a fresh position, and, on the 8th
November, Nimeguen surrendered. The Duke of York was,
for many reasons, anxious to escape an engagement, and he
intrenched himself strongly in the lines of Nimeguen. The
French commander, however, having received peremptory
orders from his Government not to desist hostilities, notwithstanding
the lateness of the season, prepared to cross
the Waal, but was prevented by the fire of the Allied
Artillery. He gave up the idea for the time, and confined
himself to making the necessary dispositions for invading
Holland in the spring;&mdash;no easy task, when one reflects on
the facilities with which the whole country could have been
flooded. Most fortunately for him an exceptionally severe
frost set in, freezing the rivers and canals so that they
could support troops and artillery. Hostilities were at once
recommenced by the French, and, after taking several
strong places in the end of December, fighting in a temperature
lower than it had been for thirty years, on the
11th January, 1795, Pichegru, with his whole army, crossed
the Waal. In the attempt made by the British to prevent
this, considerable loss was met with, and, among others, two
subalterns of Artillery, Lieutenants Walker and Legg, were
wounded.</p>

<p>From this time commenced a retreat which, for misery,
discomfort, and losses, has been compared with the French
retreat from Moscow, although on a much smaller scale. The
English Government, having resolved on the withdrawal of
the army, directed it to retire on Bremen, there to embark
for home. This order rendered it necessary for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
troops to traverse the district called the Weluwe, a perfect
<span class="sidenote">Cust.</span>
desert, over which the wind was drifting the snow into
almost impassable ridges&mdash;where the few scattered villages
had been rendered hostile by French emissaries, and where
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.</span>
“numbers of English soldiers perished through want and
weakness, and many were frozen to death.” The hardships
borne by the army did not interfere with their discipline;
and they were soothed by the sympathy of all
classes in England, and ultimately by a hearty welcome
home. With the exception of a small force under General
Dundas, which remained on the Continent until the following
year, the whole army reached England in May 1795. It
was on the 8th of that month, that the six companies of
Artillery disembarked at Woolwich, from which station they
were speedily removed to Chatham and Portsmouth.</p>

<p>The barbarous order given by the French Government
with reference to the English soldiers, which has been
mentioned above, was almost atoned for by an act of chivalry
on the part of the French troops at the end of the campaign.
During the retreat of the English, the 87th Regiment had
been left as part of the garrison of Bergen-op-Zoom. The
Dutch Government, dismayed by the continued successes
of the French, and urged on by a party in the country,
by no means inconsiderable, which sympathised with the
Republican cause, came to terms with the French Commander,
and consented to the surrender of the various
garrisons. Considerable anxiety naturally existed as to the
<span class="sidenote">Cust.</span>
fate of the 87th Regiment; “but, compromised by the
defection of an ally, it was generously permitted by the
conquerors to separate itself from the garrison, and to be
sent back to England.”</p>

<p>One or two facts remain to be mentioned. It was during
this campaign, at the affair at Boxtel, that the Duke of
Wellington, then in command of the 33rd Regiment, first
was under fire, and displayed the same coolness and intrepidity
which afterwards characterised him. It was also
during the concluding months of the war&mdash;after the resignation
of the Stadtholder&mdash;that the singular military episode
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
occurred&mdash;more singular even than that mentioned in the
<span class="sidenote">Vol. i.
p. 372.</span>
annals of the American War, when a fleet was defeated by
a field battery&mdash;the capture of a fleet by a charge of cavalry.
The Dutch fleet was lying ice-bound at the Helder&mdash;the
harbour frozen over,&mdash;and was in this position captured by
a body of Dragoons who had penetrated to that place in
relentless pursuit of the French Royalist emigrants, who
had fled thither for refuge.</p>

<p>This chapter would hardly be complete without a short
notice of an event which occurred at Toulon in 1793, and
which deserves special mention, because then for the first
time was the Royal Artillery brought face to face with a
young French Artillery officer, who was destined to become
famous, Napoleon Bonaparte. Toulon was held by the
British on behalf of the royal family of France; and part
of the force employed was a company of the Royal Artillery
from Gibraltar, under Major Koehler, the Captain-Lieutenant
of the company. Among his subalterns were Lieutenants
<span class="sidenote">Browne.</span>
Brady, Lemoine, John Duncan, Newhouse, and Alexander
Duncan; and although in December the town had to be
evacuated, this was not done until the greatest gallantry
had been displayed by the British troops. The loss in the
Artillery was very great; and the following order by General
Dundas, dated on board the ‘Victory’ on the 21st December,
<span class="sidenote">‘London
Gazette,’
17 Jan.
1794.</span>
1793, speaks well as to their skill:&mdash;“Lieutenant-General
Dundas reports, that after a most gallant defence of Toulon,
he was under the necessity of evacuating it, from the very
great superiority of the enemy’s army, and the report of
the Engineer and Artillery officers that it had become
untenable. After destroying the enemy’s men-of-war and
stores in the Dockyard, the army embarked on board our
men-of-war. As the security of this operation depended
much on the protection afforded from the happy situation
of Fort La Malgere, which so effectually commands the
neck of the Peninsula, and the judicious use that should
be made of its artillery, this important service was allotted
to Major Koehler with 200 men, who, after seeing the last
man off the shore, and spiking all the guns, effected, from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
his activity and intelligence, his own retreat without loss.
At Fort Mulgrave, Lieutenant Duncan of the Royal
Artillery was so essentially useful that to his exertions
and abilities that post was much indebted for its preservation
for so long a time.”</p>

<p>The officer last mentioned was Lieutenant John Duncan,
who was promoted in the following year, and was mentioned
as follows for his conduct at the capture of Bastia, in
Corsica, the service in which the Toulon garrison was
<span class="sidenote">Admiral
Lord
Hood’s
Despatch,
‘London
Gazette,’
10 June,
1794.</span>
next engaged:&mdash;“I cannot but express in the strongest
terms the meritorious conduct of Captain Duncan and
Lieutenant Alexander Duncan of the Royal Artillery, and
Lieutenant de Butts of the Royal Engineers; but my
obligation is particularly great to Captain Duncan, as
more zeal, ability, and judgment were never shown by any
officer than were displayed by him, and I take the liberty
of mentioning him as an officer highly entitled to His
Majesty’s notice.” Lieutenant Alexander Duncan, who
is also mentioned in this dispatch, afterwards commanded
the Royal Artillery during the defence of Cadiz in 1810-12,
at the battle of Barossa, and at Seville, at the last-mentioned
of which places he was accidentally killed.</p>

<p>During the service in Corsica, which resulted in its
surrender by the French, the Royal Artillery did duty with
Nelson’s seamen,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> and received great credit for their exertions
at the capture of Bastia and Calvi. A fatal fever
played havoc with the men; and it was found necessary to
send an additional company from England, which absorbed
the remnant of Major Koehler’s. That officer was made
Quartermaster-General to the forces in the island on its
surrender to the English, and Major Collier was sent to
command the Artillery with the title of Inspector of
Artillery.</p>

<p>This garrison remained until the evacuation of the island
by the English in 1796.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p>Even thus early, and in spite of much inexperience on the
part of their commanders, the French armies of the Revolution
had evinced merits, zeal, and courage of no ordinary
description. The new system of fighting had already
defeated the old; and when organized, as it eventually was,
by a master hand, Bonaparte, it was an engine before which
the old system, with its pedantry, sluggish precision, and
winter-quarters, was sure to go down like a house of cards.
Happily for England, there were in her army in Flanders
men like Wellington and Abercromby, who could see the
faults of the school in which they had been trained, and at
the same time not be ashamed to own the superiorities
<span class="sidenote">Major
C. B. Brackenbury,
R.A., at
U.S. Institution.</span>
which might be possessed by an enemy,&mdash;men, in fine, who,
while “conservative of glorious traditions, were fearless of
all necessary changes&mdash;endeavouring to catch the meaning
of present progress, or, with prophetic eye, reaching forward
to anticipate future developments.”</p>

<p>Without such men, the glorious stories of Egypt and the
Peninsula would have been but repetitions of this futile war
in Flanders.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="medium">1796 to 1799.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">These</span> years represent a period in the history of England
of which Englishmen must always be proud. Standing
almost alone against the French Republic, before whose victorious
armies almost every other nation in Europe succumbed,
her Government and people never hesitated to
protest, both by word and deed, against the unlawful ambition
of the French Directorate. Blinding the French people
to a sense of their hardships and their rapidly-increasing
debt by the glare of military success, and attributing these
same successes to the sudden development of martial spirit
and liberty which followed the downfall of the monarchy,
the selfish and dishonest leaders of the Republic were enabled
not merely to encourage their own army, but to sow doubt
and dissension in the ranks of their opponents. By flattering
the people they ruled, they were enabled to sin against
every rule of good government, and by creating discontent
with existing authority among other nations, for which purpose
they spared no labour nor expense, they brought France
in 1798 to a pinnacle of greatness, to which it had never yet
attained. England alone remained to defy them; and to
conquer England, either by means of invasion, isolation, or
by fomenting rebellion, was their fixed determination. The
effect on England of suspended commerce and monetary
uncertainty can be realised by the point at which the Three
<span class="sidenote">Annual
Registers.</span>
per Cents. stood during these years. In 1796 they fell to 66;
in 1797, to 56½; in 1798, the year of the Irish rebellion,
they reached 49⅝; and, after its suppression, they rose again
to 55. In 1796 the Bank of England suspended payment;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
and the discontent of the Navy was such as to render very
probable the mutinies, which took place in the following
year. The same dissatisfaction prevailed in the Army,
although to a less extent; but open expression of it was
prevented by the wisdom of the Duke of York in obtaining
for the troops an increase of pay, and thus removing the
grievance, which provoked the discontent among men, who
could barely subsist on the miserable pittance that was
allowed them. The Board of Ordnance made a similar increase
in the pay of the two Corps under their control; and
it may be interesting to state the new rates allowed for the
<span class="sidenote">B. O. Warrant,
27 May,
1797.</span>
Artillery. The Master-General, Lord Cornwallis, prefaces
his Warrant on the subject by reminding the Corps of their
former good conduct and high character, to which he had
often been a witness on the most arduous occasions, and to
which he had often borne the most ample and honourable
testimony, when he had had the honour of commanding them.
He felt sure, he wrote, that it was not in the power of the
most artful traitor to seduce the soldiers of the Royal Artillery
from their loyalty and attachment to their King and
country; and then he urged them never to prefer unreasonable
requests, whose inevitable refusal might produce discontent,&mdash;but
at the same time to rely upon his readiness to
redress any real grievance. The improvement in the pay
of the soldier may be briefly summarised from the lengthy
verbiage of the Warrant. Up to 1797, in addition to the
provision made for his clothing, pension, quarters, and medical
assistance,&mdash;and also besides his allowance of beer, &amp;c.,
provided in quarters, and of bread provided at a reduced rate
when in camp,&mdash;the soldier received a daily sum of 9½<i>d.</i>,
besides a further daily sum of 2<i>d.</i>, which under a previous
Warrant had been given in lieu of certain allowances; but,
under the new Warrant, an additional sum of 3¾<i>d.</i> was
granted, making the daily pay of the soldier 1<i>s.</i> 3¼<i>d.</i> Out
of this sum, however, the extra price of the bread and meat
ration, which had hitherto been borne by the public, was
now to be deducted; and, as this averaged 1¾<i>d.</i>, the net
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
increase of pay was 2<i>d.</i> The pay of the various ranks after
this Warrant stood as follows, viz.<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>As in 1797 beer was allowed <i>in kind</i>, in addition to the daily
pay, the one penny a day subsequently allowed in lieu of it
has not been included in the pay of the various ranks in
1873, given above.</p>

<p>The increase of pay produced a feeling of contentment in
the whole army; and if sedition had no chance of thriving
in the Artillery before, it certainly had none after. An
unsuccessful attempt having been made at Woolwich in 1797
to stir up discontent among the men, we gather, from a
General Order published shortly afterwards, that the non-commissioned
officers and men subscribed a sum of money,
which they offered as a reward for the detection of the
offenders; and, further, signed voluntarily a paper declaring
anew their loyalty to the King and fidelity to the country.
This latter step&mdash;to modern eyes somewhat superfluous in
<i>attested</i> soldiers&mdash;was doubtless called forth by certain insults
to the King which had been published, and which called
forth the indignation of the whole community; and also by
the fact that certain soldiers serving in Ireland had been
seduced from their colours by the rebels, who, under the
name of United Irishmen, were traversing the whole country.
The same feeling which prompted this action at Woolwich
expressed itself in subscriptions from the Regiment at home
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
and abroad to Mr. Pitt’s Loyalty Loan. It is recorded that
the “officers and men of the Royal Artillery at Gibraltar,
Martinique, and St. Domingo, having, as tokens of their
<span class="sidenote">Cleaveland’s
MSS.</span>
love and attachment to their King and country, transmitted
to England subscriptions, as detailed underneath, the
Master-General thought it his duty to lay the same before
His Majesty, and to observe to His Majesty how rapidly the
spirit, which had so laudably shown itself in the Artillery
at home, had spread to the detachments abroad. His
Majesty, on receiving the information, was graciously
pleased to express his approbation, and to permit the
Master-General to communicate the same to the Regiment.
<span class="sidenote">B. O.
4 June,
1798.</span>
‘The Master-General, Marquis Cornwallis, has the greatest
satisfaction in obeying this His Majesty’s command, and
takes the opportunity of congratulating the Royal Regiment
of Artillery on that zeal and alacrity, which, in all
services and in all climates and countries, have uniformly
marked the character of the Corps.’</p>

<p>“<i>Subscriptions from Gibraltar.</i>&mdash;Major-General Martin,
100<i>l.</i>; Field Officers and Captains, 30 days’ pay each;
subalterns, 14 days’ pay; non-commissioned officers and
gunners, 7 days’ pay each.</p>

<p>“<i>From Martinique.</i>&mdash;Officers, 30 days’ pay; non-commissioned
officers and gunners, 20 days’ pay each.</p>

<p>“<i>From Cape Nicholas Mole.</i>&mdash;Officers and men, 10 days’
pay each.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This feeling of loyalty was general throughout the country,
and was in no way affected either by temptation from without,
or vapouring sedition within. And to this loyal feeling, and
the noble successes of her fleets, did England owe her continued
maritime superiority and the salvation of her commerce.
<span class="sidenote">Annual
Registers.</span>
This latter had been steadily increasing; her imports
and exports had risen from 27½ millions in 1784, to 49¼
millions in 1796; and, although checked and cramped by
French legislation, her fleets kept the markets of the East
and West open. It was during this period that the great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
naval victories of Camperdown and the Nile were gained,
and that Nelson’s activity in the Mediterranean insured the
capture of Malta and Minorca by England. Nor was any sea
without the British flag. In 1799, there were in the Navy
no less than 100,000 seamen, besides 20,000 marines; and
both in the English seas and in the West Indies bomb-vessels,
with artillerymen on board, were numerous. In the
East Indies our armies were gaining renown; and in the
West Indies hostilities were going on, in which the Royal
Artillery took an active part, which resulted in the retention
of all the English islands, and the capture from the French
of St. Lucia, Martinique, St. Domingo, Trinidad, Guadaloupe,
Tobago, and Curacao. The names of some of the officers of
the Corps who were present during these operations are
given by the author of ‘England’s Artillerymen.’<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> Consisting
mainly of naval, or small detached military operations,
the wars in the West Indies possess, as a rule, little
but local interest. It may be mentioned, however, that they
were much more fatal to our troops through the fevers and
pestilence which prevailed, than the actual loss in battle.</p>

<p>The Board of Ordnance during this period did much good
work in maturing the defences of the country, which were
<span class="sidenote">Annual
Registers.</span>
under its control. In 1797, the cost of the Ordnance was
1,643,056<i>l.</i>; in 1798, 1,303,580<i>l.</i>; in 1799, 1,570,827<i>l.</i>; and

<p>It will thus be seen that, during a critical time, the
courage and determination of the people of England and
their rulers saved the country from much national hardship
and danger. But while thus facing a foreign enemy, another
foe appeared in their midst. The student of this chapter in
British history finds that it includes the story of the great
Irish rebellion of 1798.</p>

<p>If ever the sins of the fathers have been visited on the
children, it has happened in the case of England’s connection
with Ireland. The fathers ate sour grapes, and the
children’s teeth are set on edge. If we need a proof of
the strength of history as a motive power, we cannot do
better than go to Ireland. Here is a brave, a genial, a
chivalrous race, shrewd and able in the affairs of life, and
yet the mention of injustice done to their forefathers produces
to this day such a feeling of indignation and resentment,
as blinds them to the fact that the descendants of
those whose memory they detest are endeavouring, almost
to the opposite extreme, to remove all tokens of former
injustice. The history of Ireland, in its relations with
England, repeats many familiar truths; it proves that
national sins no more go unpunished, than personal; it
shows that rebellion without organisation is useless; and it
tells most distinctly that reasonable demands have often
been refused from want of judgment in the time and
manner of urging them. It proves, also, most clearly, yet
another point, for which no additional proof is required&mdash;that
the passions of a people are the very best instrument with
which unscrupulous men can work to obtain their own
private ends; and that, by stirring these up, they can so
blind men to the real goal which it is intended to reach, as
actually to make them in time believe their own&mdash;possibly
legitimate&mdash;purpose to be identical with that of their
leaders, which, if presented to them in cold blood, would
have made them shudder. He who doubts this needs only
to study the class of men called the “United Irishmen,” as
they were when first organized, and as they became under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
the manipulation of cunning leaders, and in the face of an
imprudent, unreasoning opposition. The Government of
England would have yielded much to the quiet reformers,
which they were bound to refuse to rebels; and it was this
knowledge that made the arch plotters fan discontent into
disturbance as quickly as possible, lest, with the satisfaction
of just demands and the removal of admitted grievances, the
discontent should disappear, and their own vocation
with it.</p>

<p>The story of the rebellion in Ireland in 1798 is a sorry
one; but it has its place in this history because, at some of
the more important engagements between the troops and
the rebels, such as those known as the battles of Ross,
<span class="sidenote">Now
A Battery,
A Brigade;
B Battery,
A Brigade,
and
C Battery,
A Brigade.</span>
Wexford, and Vinegar Hill, that portion of the Regiment
which had so recently been created&mdash;the Royal Horse
Artillery&mdash;was present. Two guns of A, B, and C Troops
respectively were present on these occasions. With the
exception of these, and some Battalion gun detachments, the
Artillerymen engaged during the rebellion in Ireland belonged
to the national Corps&mdash;the old Irish Artillery&mdash;whose
loyalty shone undimmed during that trying time.</p>

<p>Although the story of the rebellion itself needs not to be
told here, certain facts connected with the Artillery arrangements
will probably be found interesting.</p>

<p>From July 1795, care had been taken to impart some
knowledge of Artillery drills to the Infantry regiments in
Ireland, the custodians of the battalion guns being required
to instruct in each regiment at least 30 rank and file,
<span class="sidenote">G. O.,
7 July,
1795.</span>
under a subaltern and two sergeants. At this date the
battalion guns were not <i>brigaded</i> on field-days, as was
afterwards done; but always marched past at the head of
<span class="sidenote">General
Regulations
for
the march
of the
army in
Ireland,
12 Nov.
1796.</span>
the regiments to which they were attached. The ammunition
waggons <i>followed</i> the column.</p>

<p>On the 20th February, 1797, battalion guns were issued
to the following regiments of Militia, viz., Donegal, Clare,
Limerick City, Antrim, Kilkenny, North Mayo, Queen’s
County, and Armagh; and one “useful, well-instructed”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
<span class="sidenote">G. O.,
20 Feb.
1797.</span>
gunner from the Irish Artillery accompanied each pair of
guns, which were “to be worked by soldiers of the “regiments.”
This had been approved by the Lord-Lieutenant
on the 13th February, and orders had been given for the
immediate instruction in Artillery duties of over 300
Militiamen. This confidence in the loyalty of the Irish
troops shows that the rebellion had but little real hold in
the country, except among those with whom it will ever find
a welcome, the ignorant and fanatic.</p>

<p>It had always been a dream of France to annex Ireland,
or, failing that, to secure its independence; and the time
seemed favourable for the purpose. But, owing to circumstances
too long to be narrated here, the practical assistance
afforded by the French was almost nothing; and the rebellion,
although encouraged by French promises, received
in the end but little of French performance. It would
really seem, after dispassionate study, that the rebellion, in
the absence of the excited opposition of the Orangemen,
would never have occurred; that the removal of
the disabilities of the Catholics would at first have completely
gratified those who, after a time, would accept
nothing but national independence; and that such removal
would in all probability have been granted, had not the
moderate reformers among the United Irishmen unfortunately
accepted the leadership of men like Wolfe Tone and others,
about whose extreme and impossible views there was no
doubt whatever. The feeling of discontent was also increased
by the intemperate language of the priests, who, in
the heated expressions of their opponents, detected a possible
future for their Church, even more gloomy than its existing
state; but this last-named reason had less to do with the
birth of the rebellion, than the causes already stated. To
panic-stricken, and therefore cruel, opposition on the part
of the Protestants, and to the association of injudicious
leaders with their cause, is the fact due that men, whose
claims have been admitted by subsequent legislation to be
just, landed in 1798 in a most unfortunate rebellion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>In even the most solemn matters there is often an element
of the ludicrous; and one who is acquainted with the
national character would not be surprised to find such in an
Irish rebellion. The guns which were given to the Irish
Militia were not at first horsed; and very great difficulty
was experienced in procuring horses for the purpose. The
loyal Colonel of the Tipperary Militia, Colonel Bagwell,
offered to lend his own horses for the purpose, and his
<span class="sidenote">Dated
“Royal
Hospital,”

offer was readily accepted. A letter was then sent to the
commanding officers of other Militia Regiments, inviting
them to follow Colonel Bagwell’s example, and offering, on
the part of the Ordnance, to pay for the horses’ forage, &amp;c.,
during the time they should be employed. With very few
exceptions, the invitation was declined, and a further perusal
of the official documents suggests a very natural reason for
what would at first sight seem somewhat ungracious, if not
disloyal. On the 27th February, 1798, a letter was addressed
to the officers commanding the various districts in Ireland,
pointing out that it had reached the ears of the Commander-in-Chief
“that the limbers of the guns attached to battalions
are used for market cars, and other conveniences
for the officers and women of the regiments, and that the
horses are ridden by officers and their servants about the
country at all hours.” The knowledge of this by the
officers commanding the regiments would naturally make
them reluctant to expose their own horses to such treatment;
and a result of these irregularities was the change
<span class="sidenote">Vol. i.
p. 165,
‘Royal
Irish
Artillery.’</span>
which took place from <i>battalion guns</i> to <i>brigades</i>, already
described. It may be here stated that a considerable number
of the men of the Irish Artillery were employed in gun-boats
in the Shannon and elsewhere during the rebellion.</p>

<p>The detachments of the Royal Artillery, which were
present with the battalion guns attached to the regiments
from England, were six in number, each detachment consisting
of 1 non-commissioned officer and 9 men. The
whole were under the command of Captain Henry Geary,
assisted by three subalterns. The regiments to which they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
were attached were the Guards (three Battalions), the Queen’s,
29th, and 100th Regiments. A reinforcement of two companies
was asked for by General Lake, but the successes at
Wexford rendered it unnecessary to meet his demand.</p>

<p>At this time, H.R.H. the Duke of York ordered two
12-pounder guns to be attached to each troop of Horse
Artillery, and, as will be seen hereafter, these guns remained
part of the armament of the troop of Horse Artillery which
formed part of the expedition to the Helder, in 1799. Two
guns, from four troops respectively, went to Ireland to assist
in quelling the rebellion, but only those belonging to A, B,
and C Troops took part in the active operations. The
strength of the Horse Artillery sent to Ireland was as

following, the system of obliging surgeons to furnish the
medicines for the troops out of a fixed money allowance
should cease, and that one of the Ordnance chemists should
be appointed Regimental apothecary. An increase of pay
was also granted to the medical officers.</p>

<p>A change was also made in the Paymasters of the
Regiment. It will be remembered that Mr. Cox had been
appointed Paymaster to the Artillery in 1759. He was
<span class="sidenote">Cleaveland’s
MSS.</span>
succeeded in 1783 by Mr. Adair, who was followed by
Messrs. Meyrick. On the 1st July, 1797, the Paymastership
<span class="sidenote">Letters
from
D. A. G.</span>
was resumed by Messrs. Cox and Greenwood, and continued
in that house (subsequently Messrs. Cox and Co.) until
<span class="sidenote">Confirmed

Woollacott,
Esq.</span>
abolished on the 30th September, 1858, since which date
they have been agents to the Corps.</p>

<p>In 1797 the first Regimental School was established at
Woolwich for soldiers’ children. On the 13th August,
Captain&mdash;afterwards Sir William&mdash;Robe recommended its
<span class="sidenote">MS. by Sir

formation; and was strongly supported by the Commandant,
General Lloyd. A building, then unfinished, and now part
of the Horse Artillery Square in Woolwich Barracks, was
procured for the purpose; the Duchess of York subscribed
20 guineas for the purchase of books, and this was followed
by subscriptions from all the officers at Head-quarters. A
sergeant, named Dougherty, was appointed Schoolmaster;
and the success of the institution was so great as to induce
the Board of Ordnance to undertake its management and
support. The first pupil was a difficult, but very creditable
subject. He was the son of a gunner in the Invalid
Battalion, who lost both his arms when firing the evening
gun at an out-station for his father. So remarkable was his
progress at school, that it attracted the attention of the
military authorities; and this, taken in conjunction with the
way in which he had received his injury, obtained for him
from the Board a pension for life as a drummer,&mdash;although
he had never been enlisted as such.</p>

<p>There were a great many officers and men employed in the
Bomb service during this time; and as no stoppages were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
made for rations while the men were employed on board the
<span class="sidenote">Ordnance
Letter-books,

vessels, the service was a very popular one. Most of the
Bomb vessels were employed in the English Channel, the
Mediterranean, and among the West India Islands.</p>

<p>The employment of Artillery officers on the Staff of the
Army became more common than it had hitherto been; but,
with great short-sightedness, it was discouraged by the
Board. It was, indeed, too often made a great favour on the
part of the Master-General to allow officers to be so employed.
Among the names of officers, who can be traced as
having received the requisite permission, are Major James
M. Hadden, R.H.A., who was appointed Adjutant-General in
Portugal, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, vice Sir J.
Erskine, who resigned; Lieutenant-Colonel Koehler, who
was selected as Quartermaster-General in the Eastern
District; and Captain Duncan, who was employed on the
personal staff of H.R.H. the Duke of York. The nucleus
of an appointment, which to this day has more of a
Regimental than an Army nature, dates from this period.

On 9th June, 1797, Lieutenant A. T. Spearman was appointed
Garrison Adjutant in Woolwich. On 7th July,
1802, the title of this office was changed to Brigade-Major,
the same officer continuing to hold it; and on 1st April,
1873, the title was again altered, the incumbent, Major A. T.
G. Pearse, being styled Assistant Adjutant-General of the
Woolwich District. The Director-General of Artillery
during the period treated of in this chapter was Major-General
Duncan Drummond; the Commandants were,
successively, Generals Farrington, Congreve, and Lloyd;
and General Blomefield was Inspector of Artillery. In
1797 the Committee of Field Officers, which met periodically
to consider warlike inventions, received a more permanent
form than hitherto, foreshadowing the Ordnance Select
Committee which subsequently came into existence,&mdash;Captain
Maclean being on the 26th February appointed a standing
Secretary to the Committee.</p>

<p>On the 25th December, 1798, certain augmentations in
the pensions of widows of officers in the Army were granted;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
and the Board of Ordnance, as was invariably the case&mdash;for

(or Driver Corps) should receive pensions at the

<p>These rates, as is well known, have been increased since
the Warrant of 1799, although still so inadequate as to
render Regimental Provident Funds a necessity; but the
reader can hardly fail to be struck with the disadvantage
under which the widows of non-combatant officers laboured
in old times,&mdash;a disadvantage which disappeared with the
introduction into the Service of what is known as <i>relative
rank</i>&mdash;an arrangement which enabled non-combatant officers
to acquire by length of service the same privileges, as fell to
the lot of their combatant brethren.</p>

<p>Of these companies, as has already been stated, many men

their loyalty at a time of mutiny among the other forces on

the station. On the 4th February, 1798, the following
letter was published to the Regiment by Colonel Macleod,
having been transmitted to him by order of Major-General
Dundas, commanding the troops at the Cape of Good Hope,
who had in the first instance addressed it to Lieutenant-Colonel
Yorke, who commanded the Royal Artillery on that
station<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Commendation of loyal conduct in time of civil disturbance
is as noble a record to hoard in the story of a regiment, as
the chronicle of valour in the field. Military discipline is
indeed a miserable weapon, if it is not found true in time of
national discontent, as well as in the hour of national danger.
The great lesson for a soldier to learn is obedience; and if
that obedience is to be conditional on the soldier’s inclination,
then the nation which trains an armed force is but cherishing
a possible enemy. The lesson of silent obedience is becoming
every day more difficult to learn; discipline in civil life is
rarer than it was, and impatience of control is almost a
popular cry. What a noble mission, then, an army may
follow in time of peace! To show that men with skill and
power, and with a consciousness of these qualities, can yet
subordinate themselves for the good of the commonwealth,
instead of the individual, is surely a grand object for an
army’s purpose. And in the daily life of such a force a
nation might read a lesson, which, if taught from the mouths
of rulers or the pulpits of preachers, would fall on deaf, because
doubting ears; for a suspicion dogs the heels of the
mere speaker, which vanishes before the open and consistent
life of the actor.</p>

<p>Yet a few more statistics before the chapter closes. It has
been necessary to talk with disparagement of the field brigades,
as distinguished from the troops of Horse Artillery in
the conclusion of the last century. But if the quality of
the Field Artillery was indifferent, its quantity would have
<span class="sidenote">B. O.

the Duke
of York.</span>
satisfied an alarmist. On the 19th February, 1798, there
were, in England alone, 126 battalion 6-pounder guns, besides
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
brigades and parks of artillery, consisting of 29
12-pounders, 36 long 6-pounders, and 28 5½-inch howitzers.
These were distributed in Newcastle, Hull, Woodbridge,
Colchester, Warley, Canterbury, Dover, Lewes, Plymouth,
and St. Austell; and there was a further reserve at Woolwich
of 12 12-pounders, 30 long 6-pounders, 3 8-inch howitzers,
12 5½-inch howitzers, and 30 light 6-pounders.</p>

<p>This seems a formidable force on paper, and it doubtless
soothed many a terrified alarmist, and silenced many an
honourable member on the Opposition benches. But, alas!
both these desirable ends may often be attained by an official
return, and yet the evil may not be removed. Had the
House demanded that the means of locomotion for this
powerful force of artillery should be produced, it is to be
feared that the men would have been scarce and the horses
scarcer. And yet the official return had its value. The
authorities concerned always managed&mdash;it may be at great
expense&mdash;to produce the necessary armament at the eleventh
hour; and the balance was merely so much dust thrown in
the eyes of honourable members, as a sort of Parliamentary
tribute.</p>

<p>Official returns may be misleading, and yet the units of
the force to which they relate may be worthy of all praise.
Rising from the contemplation of faded pages, and the
analysis of the Regimental correspondence between 1796
and 1799, the chronicler feels that there were in the Corps
at that time men whose hearts were so engrossed in their
work, even in this time of sad rebellion, of national depression,
of uninteresting warfare, that they could truly say,
with the poet who was to come in later years&mdash;and with no
exaggeration, but merely in a simple expression of what was
uppermost in their daily thoughts<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<span class="medium smcap">The Christening of the Chestnut Troop.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> course of our narrative brings us again to the Continent
of Europe. In the year 1798, an expedition was
ordered from England, with a view to the destruction of the
basin, gates, and sluices of the Bruges Canal, and the consequent
injury to the internal navigation between Holland,
Flanders, and France. The prevention of a meditated invasion
of England by the French would, it was hoped, by
this means also be ensured. The naval part of the expedition
was under the control of Captain Home Popham, while
the military force was commanded by General Sir Eyre
Coote. Eight companies of the Guards, the 11th Regiment,
and the flank companies of the 23rd and 49th Regiments,
<span class="sidenote">D.A. Gen.’s
Correspondence.</span>
constituted the Infantry employed; and the Artillery consisted
of two companies attached to a battery of four
6-pounders and three light howitzers. The Artillery officers
were Captain W. H. Walker (in command), Captain&mdash;afterwards
Sir Wiltshire&mdash;Wilson, Captain C. Godfrey, Lieutenants
Simpson, Hughes, Ilbert, and Holcroft. The guns were
carried in different vessels, and landed near Ostend. On the
19th May, at daybreak, the troops disembarked, and commenced
destroying the works. In a few hours they undid
the labour of five years, besides burning a number of transports,
which had been collected for the conveyance of French
regiments to England; but this was not effected without
considerable loss. When, however, the English force attempted
to re-embark, it was found to be impossible, owing
to the high wind which prevailed and the heavy sea. It was
therefore found necessary, after going through the empty
form of summoning the citadel, to encamp for the night on
the sands. The English were attacked at daybreak by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
enemy in overwhelming numbers; and after a severe action,
in which Sir Eyre Coote was wounded, the whole force was
compelled to surrender. The conduct of the Artillery was
worthy of their comrades in the battle; and their commander,
Captain Walker, received wounds from which he died.
Of the rest the following official mention was made:&mdash;“Captains
<span class="sidenote">‘London
Gazette,’
21 July,
1798.</span>
Wilson and Godfrey, and Lieutenants Simpson,
Hughes, and Holcroft, all of the same distinguished Corps,
after having done everything men could do, spiked their
guns and threw them over the banks at the moment the
enemy was possessing himself of them. The latter gentleman,
Lieutenant Holcroft, when all his men were wounded
except one, remained at his gun, doing duty with it to the
<span class="sidenote">D. A. Gen.,
R.A., to
Lieut.-Gen.
of the
Ordnance,

best of his ability.” From subsequent official correspondence
we learn that the following officers were permitted,
with their soldier-servants, to return to England on parole,
viz., Captain Wilson, Lieutenants Simpson, Hughes, and
Holcroft, Captain Godfrey remaining at Lille with the men.
From a plaintive letter to the Deputy-Adjutant-General,
written by the last-named officer, it would appear that the prisoners
were in a very sorry plight; for he implored an advance
of pay for all, as they “wanted almost everything sorely.”</p>

<p>Next year an expedition on a larger scale took place,
although not much more fortunate. It has an especial
interest to the Artilleryman, as being the first expedition in
which a general officer of Artillery was considered necessary
with the force, on account of the large proportion present
belonging to that arm. General Pattison, who had held a
command in America, did so as an <i>Army</i> not as an <i>Artillery</i>
General; and General Phillips, who also commanded in that
war, was merely a regimental field officer, with army rank
as General. The expedition to the Helder, in 1799, had
a contingent of Artillery, consisting of one troop of Horse
Artillery, and eight companies of Marching Artillery, as
they were termed. The troop was A, or the Chestnut
Troop, commanded by Major Judgson; and although part
of it had taken a share in the suppression of the Irish
rebellion, this was the first occasion on which any portion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
of the Royal Horse Artillery proceeded on <i>foreign</i> active
service; and, as will appear, the troop had rather a rough
<span class="sidenote">Vol. i.
p. 378.</span>
<i>baptême de feu</i>. General Farrington was selected for the
command of Artillery, receiving the following letter from the
<span class="sidenote">D. A. Gen.’s
Correspondence.</span>
Deputy Adjutant-General, on the 8th August, 1799:&mdash;“In
conversation yesterday with Lord Howe, he observed that
if the expedition now embarked was to be followed by
the troops and Artillery ordered to be in preparation, he
should consider it necessary for them to be accompanied
by not only an Artillery officer of experience and abilities,
but by one high in rank in the Corps; and under that
idea I was desired to address myself to you, to know if
your health would admit of his proposing you to the
Commander-in-Chief for the command of the whole....”
The offer was eagerly accepted by the General, and his
appointment was confirmed. He selected Captain&mdash;afterwards
Sir William&mdash;Robe as his Brigade-Major, and Captain
Maclean as his Aide-de-Camp.</p>

<p>The expedition was in two divisions: the first, under Sir
Ralph Abercromby, going from Southampton, while the
second, and main division, was being assembled in Kent.
When united, the command-in-chief was to be assumed by
the Duke of York. Sir R. Abercromby applied for Lieut.-Colonel&mdash;afterwards
Sir Francis&mdash;Whitworth to command
the Artillery of his division, and his request was complied
<span class="sidenote">MS. Returns
to
the Board
of Ordnance.</span>
with. The following was the strength of General Abercromby’s
Artillery, viz.: 1 field officer, 6 captains, 13 subalterns,
2 surgeons, 40 non-commissioned officers, 371 gunners,
and 6 drummers. There were also present with him,
belonging to the Driver Corps, 1 subaltern, 3 quartermaster
commissaries, 15 non-commissioned officers, 152 drivers,
5 artificers, and 200 horses.</p>

<p>The main Artillery force, under General Farrington, which
followed that just given, was of considerable strength, including,
<span class="sidenote">D. A. Gen.
R.A. Correspondence.</span>
besides Major Judgson’s Troop, Lieut.-Colonels
Smith and Trotter, 9 captains, 14 subalterns, 1 surgeon,
43 non-commissioned officers, 412 gunners, and 8 drummers,
besides a detachment of the Driver Corps, consisting of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
1 captain, 4 quartermaster-commissaries, 12 non-commissioned
officers, 166 drivers, 9 artificers, and 400 horses. The
strength of Major Judgson’s Troop was as follows: 2 captains,
3 subalterns, 1 surgeon, 16 non-commissioned officers,
97 gunners, 58 drivers, 7 artificers, and 1 trumpeter; making
a total of 185, besides 191 horses.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> A second troop of Horse
<span class="sidenote">*Captain

Artillery* was put under orders, but did not embark; and of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
a further detachment of the Driver Corps, which was held in
readiness, consisting of 226 men and 400 horses, about one-half
ultimately went, if not more.</p>

<p>The whole Artillery force which it was at first intended
should be sent&mdash;including the Driver-Corps auxiliaries&mdash;amounted
to 1857 officers and men and 1344 horses; and of
this number certainly 1600 men and 1000 horses accompanied
the expedition. Among the names of officers not yet
mentioned, who accompanied the Army to the Helder, the
letters of the period include the following: Brevet Lieut.-Colonel
Terrot, Major Lewis, Captain Mudge, Captain&mdash;afterwards
Sir Augustus&mdash;Frazer, Captain Riou, Captain
Nicholls, Captain Ramsey, Captain-Lieutenant Geary, Lieutenant
Knox, Lieutenant Morrison, and Assistant-Surgeon
Jameson. From other sources we learn that two officers, who
subsequently attained great distinction in the Corps, were
<span class="sidenote">Memoir of
Sir E. C.

also present&mdash;Sir E. C. Whinyates and Sir John Michell&mdash;both
officers being then 2nd Lieutenants. Lieutenants
<span class="sidenote">Kane’s

Simpson and Eligée are also known to have been present,
<span class="sidenote">Browne’s
‘England’s
Artillerymen.’</span>
from the fact that both were among the wounded in the
actions which took place. The reason why uncertainty prevails
as to the regimental details of the Artillery force on
this expedition will appear at the end of this chapter.</p>

<p>It will be readily understood that so large a force was not
collected without difficulty. But of the extent of the labour
involved no one can adequately judge who has not had access
to the official letter-books of the time. The expedition to
the Helder proved at once the necessity of a head-quarters
staff for the Royal Artillery, and the capacity of the man
who had been selected as the first Deputy-Adjutant-General
of the Corps. The later campaigns, in whose organization
Sir John Macleod had so large a share, were undoubtedly on
a grander scale; but it is questionable whether his zeal, tact,
and activity were ever so prominent, as in the arrangements
for this unfortunate expedition to Holland. He did everything,
and made a point of knowing everything, himself: he
gave himself no rest until he accomplished his purpose; nor
yet did the amount of his official labours interfere with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
courtesy to all ranks for which he was so remarkable. A
private letter of friendly notice always preceded the order
for movement, where such intimation could be given without
detriment to the Service; no unnecessary mystery attended
his actions: he was almost laboriously anxious to meet the
convenience of all concerned, and evinced in his letters a
sympathy, such as he could not have surpassed in his
dealings with his own relations. His correspondence with
the various commanding officers, from under whose control
he had to steal detachments to bring the companies for service
up to their required strength, is a masterpiece. Never for
one moment leaving the line of action which necessity and
the Board had imposed on him, he yet seemed to consult and
defer to the Generals whose divisions he was weakening, and
to obtain by their consent what he really was taking by force.
If ever a wrong system, such as the old dual government of
the Artillery was, could be made less detestable, it was made
so by Colonel Macleod’s tact and courtesy. And it is better
that the deformities of a military system should be laid
bare in time of <i>peace</i>, than on the eve of <i>war</i>, when the
almost inevitable confusion cannot afford to be increased by
ill-timed revelations. An indifferent machine well-worked
is better than an admirable one whose powers are paralysed
by some temporary, but thorough disarrangement. It is not
when breakers are ahead, that men speculate on the beauties
of their engines: it is <i>then</i> that&mdash;be they what they may&mdash;they
are expected to work to the utmost of their power. In
the hands of Colonel Macleod the evils of a wrong system
were reduced to a <i>minimum</i>: but the system was a wrong
one still.</p>

<p>His exertions to perfect the force which he had to organize
were as admirable, as were his endeavours to remove all possible
friction. There have been times in our military history,
when the great wheel of progress and success has&mdash;after
much creaking&mdash;been set in motion by the untiring exertions
of unexpected leaders, or uncomplaining heroism in the
ranks, instead of the labours of those on whom the organization
of the armies depended. And at such times of unexpected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
fortune, it has generally been found that the official
flies have buzzed most loudly around the revolving wheel, as
if they had been the motive power. Not so with Colonel
Macleod in 1799. Nothing was beneath his notice; no
exertion was spared by him which could ensure the perfection,
as well as the harmony, of the machine. The same
pages which reveal his consideration for individuals show
also his determination to render the Artillery part of the
expedition unrivalled: and his difficulties were very great.
In the single item of horses, he found an obstacle which bid
fair to be insurmountable; for the horses did not exist in
the service, and could hardly be bought. Such animals as
were procured by scouring the country were in so wretched
a condition, that they could barely crawl in harness. So important
was every day of decent rations to the sorry brutes,
that to every party marching to the port of embarkation&mdash;Ramsgate&mdash;Colonel
Macleod sent orders to shorten the
marches, and to delay going on board as long as possible&mdash;and
<span class="sidenote">D. A. Gen.’s
Correspondence.</span>
at all hazards, “except,” he wrote, “that of allowing it
to be said, ‘We are waiting for the Ordnance.’”</p>

<p>Among other evils was the monotonous cry from distant
colonies&mdash;not only heard in 1799, nor by one Deputy Adjutant-General&mdash;of
“More men from England!” Every place
was drained of every available man; even the old gunners at
the Tower were drafted away, and raw recruits sent in their
place: but the colonial wants were not satisfied. Militia
regiments, which were embodied, were also sending daily
petitions for battalion guns, followed by remonstrances and
strongly-worded indignation. And Colonel Macleod, in spite
of his <i>personal</i> opinions, was obliged to strain every nerve
to meet a wish, which was still supported by our military
system. His personal opinions, it has been said,&mdash;and truly:
for the correspondence of the period reveals the fact that
Colonel Macleod had commenced to detest the existing
system of battalion guns. He dared not say openly what
he thought; but from a private letter written at this time
his opinion may be easily learnt. Writing of some detachments
which had been collected under an officer’s command,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
<span class="sidenote">Letter to
Colonel&mdash;afterwards
Sir John&mdash;Smith.</span>
he said: “I believe they are intended for the battalion guns
of the Infantry Brigades, and I had some thoughts of
drawing them to Chatham, where I would have them
drilled to the duty expected of them&mdash;appointing 1 non-commissioned
officer and 7 gunners to each 6-pounder, and
accustoming them to make use of a horse to advance,
<i>instead of drag-rope men</i>&mdash;a custom which weakens the
battalions they are attached to without aiding the services
of the Artillery. For, between you and I, six men are <i>too
few to drag guns</i>, and <i>too many to stand with ropes in their
hands to be shot at</i>.”</p>

<p>An incident, which occurred at this time, shows that the
system of drawing lots was not confined to choice of stations
or barracks at home. In a letter to the commanding officer
at Newcastle&mdash;Colonel Lawson&mdash;Colonel Macleod, in calling
for one of the companies under his command for service in
the expedition, requested him to assemble the Captains, and
make them draw lots for the duty.</p>

<p>It was in August 1799 that the force sailed from England;
and the student, who has realised the labours of Colonel
Macleod, will also be able to conceive the feelings of relief
with which he despatched, at 3 <small>A.M.</small> on a day at the beginning
of that month, a mounted orderly, to carry the intelligence
from Woolwich to the Duke of York at Deal, that the
last man and horse of the Artillery had embarked. It will
now be necessary to follow the expedition, merely remarking
here that the casualties, which speedily occurred, rendered a
fresh supply of ammunition and horses necessary before many
weeks had passed, and that consequently Colonel Macleod
had but a brief respite from his toil.</p>

<p>The expedition to the Helder was intended to effect two
things&mdash;the capture of the Dutch fleet, which in the hands
of the French was an unmistakable danger to England, and
a military demonstration in Holland, which should lead to a
rising against the Republican Government. In the first of
these objects the expedition succeeded; in the second it
miserably failed. For an exhibition of fruitless gallantry, it
has not been surpassed in the annals of the British Army.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
But happily it was the closing scene in the drama of military
failure, with which the last decade of the eighteenth century
was surfeited. With the new century came a spirit in England’s
military operations, which made her campaigns by
land as glorious as her successes by sea. The wars of the
nineteenth century threw into the background the share
taken by our armies in the wars of the French Revolution,
during the period which preceded the overthrow of the
Directorate in France and the virtual assumption of the
supreme power by Napoleon in the winter of 1799. But the
Regimental historian has to bring even fruitless and unsuccessful
wars to light again, in his search for stories of individual
gallantry or for the causes of failure.</p>

<p>England’s ally in the expedition to the Helder was Russia.
It had been arranged by the two governments that the land
forces should comprise a Russian contingent of 17,000 men,
and an English army of 13,000. England more than fulfilled
her promise: for the actual force sent by her was as
much as that promised as the Russian contribution. In addition,
England furnished vessels to assist in the transport
of the Russian troops from the Baltic, and a powerful fleet,
of more than sixty men-of-war, under Admiral Lord Duncan.
On the 21st August, 1799, the fleet and transports arrived
off the mouth of the Zuyder Zee, and anchored off the
Helder: but foul weather prevented a disembarkation until
the 27th,&mdash;a delay which gave undoubted advantage to the
French and Batavian troops. The enemy was at first under
the command of General Daendels, but he was almost immediately
superseded by General Brune; and the army, which
had at first been 10,000 strong, rose in a few weeks to nearly
treble that number.</p>

<div class="sidenote">23rd, 27th,
29th, 55th,
and 85th
Regiments.</div>

<p>Abercromby’s division was the first to land, and after a
very severe engagement, in which the Infantry under Generals
Sir James Pulteney and Coote behaved most gallantly,
the Dutch were driven back, and the English took possession
of the Kirkduin, and the fort of the Helder. The Artillery
was not landed till after this engagement: nor was the
<span class="sidenote">Cust.</span>
ground favourable to the use of the Dutch artillery. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
fleet was summoned to surrender: and the Dutch Admiral,
conscious of a strong spirit of insubordination among his
crews, ever since the appearance of the British flag, consented
to deliver over his ships, unconditionally; and thus
gave over to the English the complete control of the Zuyder
Zee. On this taking place, the Dutch troops retired, and
took up a position in front of Alkmaar, where they were
joined by General Brune and 7000 French. Abercromby
occupied the ground vacated by the Dutch, and strengthened
it in every way possible, being resolved to await there the
arrival of the Duke of York and the Russian contingent.
General Brune, however, saw the advantage of an engagement
before such a junction could be effected; and therefore
on the 10th September he assumed the offensive, but without
success,&mdash;being totally defeated with a loss of 2000 men.
<span class="sidenote">‘London
Gazette,’
16 Sept.
1799.</span>
The Artillery was of great service to Abercromby; and it
was in this engagement&mdash;known as the action of Zyp&mdash;that
Lieutenant Simpson was wounded. The French resumed
their old position in front of Alkmaar, which they greatly
strengthened; and confined their operations to preventing
Abercromby from advancing out of the contracted space in
which he was situated.</p>

<p>On the 12th September the Russians arrived, and on the
day following the Duke of York assumed the command, and
resolved on leaving the position where the army had been
stationed, and on attacking the enemy with the large force
now at his disposal, numbering about 35,000 men. He
divided his army into four columns: the right being under
General Hermann, and composed entirely of Russians;
the second, under General Dundas, consisting partly of
British, and partly of Russians; the third, under Sir James
Pulteney, with a large proportion of Artillery and Cavalry;
and the fourth, under Sir Ralph Abercromby, consisting
entirely of British troops; the last being intended to make a
<i>détour</i> on the evening of the 18th September&mdash;the day before
the intended battle&mdash;and to turn the enemy’s right flank. The
first three columns were ordered to attack simultaneously at
break of day on the 19th, moving on different named points.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
These arrangements, which have been somewhat severely
criticised, would doubtless have succeeded, had the Duke’s
orders been obeyed; but unfortunately the first, or Russian,
column precipitated the engagement by attacking the enemy
two or three hours before the other columns were ready to
move, and drove the enemy out of the village of Bergen.
General Brune brought up his reserve to recover his lost
ground, and fell upon the Russian troops when in a state of
intoxication from the excesses of which they had been guilty
since the capture of the village. A disgraceful scene followed,
ending in the tumultuous flight of the Russians with
the loss of many prisoners. The Duke of York accompanied
the second column, but the retreat of the Russians on his
right compelled him to fall back, and to send orders to the
third and fourth columns to do the same. Great success
had in the meantime attended the efforts of Sir James
Pulteney,&mdash;the Guards, 17th and 40th Regiments, having
greatly distinguished themselves; but, owing to the change
given to the whole plan by the mistake and misbehaviour
of the first column, when night came the Allies occupied
precisely the same ground as they held in the morning. The
loss to the English amounted to 500 killed and wounded,
and 500 taken prisoners;&mdash;and the Russians lost 3000 men;
but an equal number of the enemy had been taken prisoners
by the Allies. In this engagement, known as the battle
of Bergen or Alkmaar, the loss of the Royal Artillery was as
follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">‘London

<span class="i0"><i>Missing</i>: 7 gunners, and gunner-drivers.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the interval between this engagement and the severe
battle on the 2nd October,&mdash;when the event occurred which
gives the title to the present chapter,&mdash;both armies were
employed in strengthening their positions on shore, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
obtaining reinforcements, and in arranging their respective
gun-boats in such a way as to obtain from them an enfilade fire,
in event of attack. The Duke of York felt the importance
of making a final effort, before the season was further advanced:
and his dispositions on the 2nd October were much
the same as on the 19th September, except that he gave the
right column to General Abercromby, whose force consisted
of 8000 Infantry and 1000 Cavalry, with Major Judgson’s
<span class="sidenote">General
Farrington
to D. A. G.
17 Sept.
1799.</span>
troop of Horse Artillery. The troop was partly armed with
12-pounders,&mdash;a very heavy armament for Horse Artillery,
and one never again used:&mdash;and it seems all the more
unsuitable, when we find that the battalion guns, which
were merely 6-pounders, were in one instance brigaded into
a battery under Captain Frazer,&mdash;presenting the anomaly
in the army, on this 2nd October, of a <i>light</i> field artillery,
intended for rapid movements, being armed with guns of
twice the calibre of those used by what should have been the
<i>medium</i> field artillery, and only required to accommodate
itself to the movements of infantry.</p>

<p>The second column was composed of Russian troops, under
Count Essen; the third was under General Dundas; and
the fourth under Sir James Pulteney. The main interest
attaches to the first column, whose duty it was to keep close
to the seashore as far as Egmont-op-Zee, and thence
menace the French left and rear. The other columns were
to drive back the enemy’s line if possible; and, at all events,
so to occupy him as to prevent the left from being strengthened
in such a manner as might endanger the success of the
first column. The exertions of General Dundas’s brigade
were marvellous, and were crowned by success; but they
were almost undone by the refusal of the Russians, at a
critical moment, to advance against the village of Bergen,
which had been laid bare by the retreat of the enemy before
the impetuosity of the English troops. This refusal was
never forgotten, nor was there from that hour any harmony
between the allied troops. Encouraged by the impunity
allowed them, the enemy resumed the offensive; but,
although unable to drive them farther back, the English
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
succeeded, although with great loss and difficulty, in holding
the ground they had taken.</p>

<p>The first column, under General Abercromby, reached
Egmont-op-Zee without difficulty; but there it found a large
force of all arms, under General Vandamme, drawn up in
line of battle. The engagement which followed was prolonged
and bloody. Sir Ralph was at last successful; but
his advantage was short-lived, for reinforcements arrived
from Alkmaar in such numbers that it required all the skill
of the English General, and all the undaunted courage of
his men, to prevent his left from being broken before night
put an end to the engagement. It was at this time that
the Chestnut Troop received its baptism of fire. By some
oversight on the part of the General, or possibly owing to
ignorance as to the powers of this new weapon&mdash;Horse
Artillery,&mdash;Major Judgson’s Troop had been advanced to a
dangerous distance, and left with an inadequate escort.
General Vandamme observed this, and, placing himself at
the head of his Cavalry, swept down upon the guns. The
scene which followed was an exciting one. Taken by surprise,
the gunners did not lose their presence of mind, but
fired into the advancing cavalry until they were in their
midst; and then, with any weapons they had, they struggled
with the troopers, who, in immense numbers, surrounded
them, and sabred them at their guns. According to one
<span class="sidenote">Browne.</span>
account, two only of the guns were carried off by the
<span class="sidenote">Cust.</span>
cavalry when they retired; according to another, the whole
were captured. Be it as it may, the prize was not left long
undisputed, for Lord Paget, placing himself at the head of
the 15th Light Dragoons&mdash;now the 15th (King’s) Hussars&mdash;charged
the enemy’s cavalry, pursuing them for over a
mile; and, assisted by the explosion of one of the captive
limbers, succeeded in recovering all the guns. The story is
calculated to create a friendly sympathy between the Chestnut
Troop and the gallant Regiment which proved so staunch
a godfather to it at this its christening, and is one to be
talked over by the camp-fire in days coming on. In the
order which was issued after the battle, Major Judgson
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
<span class="sidenote">‘London
Gazette,’
24 Oct.
1799.</span>
received special mention. “In the severe action on this day
His Royal Highness expressed his thanks to Lieutenant-Colonels
Whitworth and Smith, who commanded the
Artillery of reserve, and to Major Judgson, of the Horse
Artillery. Captain Nicholls was wounded in this action,
and is since dead.”</p>

<p>Although the Allies had not driven the enemy back as far
as they had hoped, they nevertheless occupied the ground
on which the French General had taken up his position, at
the commencement of the battle. The loss to the British
was severe, 1300 having been killed and wounded, including
100 officers.</p>

<p>Another attempt was made by the Allies on the 7th
October to drive the enemy back, and to escape from the
position in which they had been cramped since the commencement
of the campaign; but, although they defeated
with severe loss the troops to whom they found themselves
immediately opposed, the <i>cordon</i> beyond still hopelessly surrounded
them. As there was no symptom of a popular
rising in the country on their behalf, and as reinforcements
were daily reaching the French, the Duke of York decided
on opening negotiations with a view to the evacuation of
Holland by the Allies. These were ultimately successful;
and the only beneficial result of this campaign, which survived
the negotiations, was the retention of the Dutch fleet
by the English.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the Artillery share in this campaign
had an element of the ludicrous in it. In the old letter-books,
deposited in the Royal Artillery Record Office, is the
following one, showing the pitiable way in which poor
General Farrington, who had left with all the pomp and
circumstance of war, returned to his home. Writing from
<span class="sidenote">To D. A.
General,
Nov. 3,
1799.</span>
Blackheath, he says:&mdash;“After a very fatiguing voyage and
journey, I am this moment arrived at my own house.
Trotter, Smith, Terrott, Robe, Maclean, Lieut. Knox, and
Dr. Jameson, came over passengers with me, and will be
at Woolwich this night, or to-morrow morning. The want
of horses keeps them back, and my anxiety of mind to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
arrive as early as possible led me to accept a passage in a
post-chaise; but I have a melancholy tale to unfold. The
ship in which we came passengers, mistaking the entrance
into Yarmouth Harbour, ran on the sands, on which she
struck with such violence as, with the first shock, to
unship her rudder, and stave in her bottom; but, wonderful
to tell, after keeping us in a most distressed state for
an hour, she passed the sands with 4 feet of water in her
hold, and, by the exertion of the boats of the fleet,
every soul on board was saved&mdash;about 70 in number;
and in about half an hour the ship sank in 10 or 11
fathoms of water. The cargo, such as guns, shot, and
shells, may  be  saved; the ammunition, of course,
destroyed; and <i>we are all reduced to our ship-dress
only</i>; everything else lost. It has been a most providential
escape, and sincerely ought we to offer up our
prayers for His mercy.</p>

<p>“I am too unwell to wait upon Lord Howe, <i>nor have I
things to see  him in</i>; but if you could ride over here
to-morrow, I will tell you all I can respecting the embarkation
of the Artillery horses, &amp;c., <i>for I have not a
paper left</i>.”</p>

<p>While sympathising with the ill-fated General, the student
cannot refrain from anathematising the blundering pilot,
who mistook the entrance to Yarmouth Harbour, and was
thus the cause of papers being lost, which would doubtless
have been priceless to the compiler of a narrative of the
Artillery share in the campaign of 1799.</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> history of the Regiment in 1800 and 1801 has its
main interest in the operations of the English Army
in Egypt. In these, so glorious in a military point of view,
so effective in a national,&mdash;for they were the main instrument
in bringing about the Peace of Amiens&mdash;the Artilleryman
finds much to interest him, and much of which he may be
justly proud.</p>

<p>It is fortunate for the purpose of this history that the
officer who commanded the Artillery in Egypt placed on
<span class="sidenote">Brig.-Gen.
Lawson’s
MSS. on
Egypt,
deposited

record many most interesting details, which the general
historian would have certainly overlooked, and whose reproduction
in these pages will give a far more graphic sketch of
the difficulties which were encountered, than could be given
by the most skilful writer who had not himself been an eye-witness.
The unpretending account of the means adopted
to overcome the difficulties cannot fail also to inspire any
officer, who may find himself in a similar position, with a
resolution to yield to no obstacles.</p>

<p>The reader will remember that in the year 1800 there was
a French army stationed in Egypt, which, although reduced
from its original numbers, was yet too strong to be overcome
by the Turks. England resolved to reinforce the Turkish
army by means of an expedition from England, the military
part of which was to be commanded by Sir R. Abercromby;
the naval, by Admiral Lord Keith. The Artillery of the
Expedition was placed under the command of Colonel Lawson,
who, after much importunity, obtained from the Duke of
York the rank of Brigadier-General. Officers of his own
standing had obtained that rank to command brigades of
Infantry on the Expedition; and Colonel Macleod, although,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
<span class="sidenote">Correspondence

as he wrote, “bewildered with orders and projects, alterations

landing at Gibraltar a company of the 6th Battalion, receiving
one of the 5th Battalion in exchange. The battalions
actually represented in Egypt were the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th,
and the companies, which were present are detailed in the
first volume of this work. The 3rd Battalion was at this
time mainly stationed in the West Indies.</p>

<p>On the 5th May, 1800, General Lawson reached Portsmouth
to take command of the Artillery of the Expedition,
which he had been informed was on the point of sailing. He
had also been informed that all necessary particulars had
been communicated to him by the authorities; but in neither
respect was his information correct, and the official fountain
of his knowledge was found to have poured forth a somewhat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
muddy stream. Three weeks elapsed before he sailed&mdash;three
weeks of wild, hopeless confusion&mdash;affairs having been complicated
by the Government having decided on a secret expedition
elsewhere, the Artillery of which was placed under the
orders of Colonel Seward, then in command at Portsmouth.
An interchange of companies between his force and that of
General Lawson was threatened, and mutual drafts were
made, as far as officers and a few men were concerned.
Another company, under Major Cookson, who distinguished
himself subsequently in Egypt, joined General Lawson at
Portsmouth&mdash;a fact of which the student first becomes
aware by finding a joint letter from the subalterns of the
company, petitioning the Board, with considerable presence
of mind, for an advance of pay, they “being quite out of
cash.” It is presumed that their request was granted, for,

Lawson’s force had sailed by the 3rd June, and reached
Gibraltar on the 22nd of the same month. The gallant
General’s existence had been embittered during the last few
days of his stay in England by the masterly silence, profound
as the grave, with which all his inquiries for information,
reiterated daily, were received by the Board. The subsequent
difficulties which he encountered were mainly due
to this triumph of official reticence.</p>

<p>Leaving General Lawson’s force at Gibraltar, let the
reader return for a moment to that under Colonel Seward,
which was to form part of the Secret Expedition. The Royal
Artillery employed consisted of 386 of all ranks, besides
that marvellous accompaniment of all expeditions in those
days, whether secret or open,&mdash;22 women and 11 children.
The armament consisted of 16 light 6-pounders. Three
companies were taken complete, commanded by Major
<span class="sidenote">Embarkation
Returns,
D. A.
General’s
Correspondence.</span>
Borthwick, Captain Salmon, and Brevet-Lieut.-Colonel
Bentham; and the following officers accompanied the force:
Captains-Lieutenant S. G. Adye and A. MacDonald; 1st
Lieutenants W. R. Carey, E. Curry, T. Masson, R. Carthew,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
S. Maxwell, D. Campbell, W. Holcombe, and L. Carmichael;
2nd Lieutenants W. Norman Ramsay, W. D. Nicolls, J. Rollo,
and H. B. Lane. Major Borthwick was appointed by
Colonel Seward Brigade-Major to the Artillery. Besides
these three companies, drafts from almost every company
in England were taken to complete them to their
proper establishment, and to man the battalion guns. This
heart-breaking system of robbing one company to feed
the wants of another prevailed to a great and continual
extent during the earlier part of this century, and its evil
results show the vast improvement of the depôt system,
which clothes the cadres of dwindling batteries abroad,
without taking from those at home the men trained in and
for themselves.</p>

<p>Considerable trouble was experienced by Colonel Seward
in obtaining the co-operation of commanding officers of
regiments in matters relating to the battalion guns; and
this expedition acted as another nail, so to speak, in the
coffin of that objectionable system. But infinitely greater
was the trouble caused by the vacillation and uncertainty of
the authorities, who, after the embarkation of the whole
force, sent orders for it to disembark and encamp near
Southampton, until they could arrive at some decision as to
its destination. This afforded an opportunity for clerkdom
to run riot. Questions as to ship rations and land rations,
ship pay and land pay, poured on the ill-fated captains of
companies every day; and seldom did a mail reach them
without a disallowance.</p>

<p>At length the expedition set sail (the military part of the
force being placed under Sir James Pulteney), and made an
attempt on Ferrol, in whose harbour some large men-of-war
were lying. The troops landed under a covering fire from the
English fleet, and in the skirmish which followed they had
<span class="sidenote">Cust’s
‘Annals of
the Wars.’</span>
the advantage. But, Sir James Pulteney, becoming alarmed
at the strength of the Spanish works, and at the news he
received of their preparations, re-embarked the troops the
same evening, and sailed for Gibraltar. Here Colonel
Seward transferred to Colonel Lawson many of his officers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
men, and stores; and with the remainder, and all the sick,
he went to Lisbon, whence&mdash;pending his return to England&mdash;he
<span class="sidenote">D. A.
General’s
Correspondence.</span>
wrote the most gloomy letters, that ever crossed the
threshold of Colonel Macleod’s office. The transfer of his
officers to General Lawson’s command at Gibraltar, and the
receipt of others from the companies in garrison, account for
the presence in Egypt of many who did not embark with
the latter from England, such as Major Sprowle, Captains
Duncan and Adye, and Lieutenants D. Campbell, Sturgeon,
and Burslem. One of the companies which sailed from
<span class="sidenote">B. General

England with General Lawson was landed at Gibraltar in
exchange for Major Sprowle’s; and by this means the glories
of Egypt were denied to Captain Meredith and Lieutenants
Cleaveland, Michell, and Nutt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Colonel
Cuppage,

<p>From Gibraltar General Lawson went to Minorca, which
he reached on the 10th July, after a tedious passage of
nineteen days. Here he landed his men to await the return
of Sir R. Abercromby, who had at first started for Genoa,
with all the troops he could collect from Minorca and elsewhere.
While on the passage, however, Sir Ralph received
a message from the Admiral, Lord Keith, informing him
that the Austrians had evacuated Italy. He therefore
diverted his course to Leghorn, where he remained a week,
and then went on to Malta. When the citadel of Valetta
in that island was given up by the French in September,
and Malta passed into the hands of the English, General
Lawson followed Sir Ralph, and the expedition to Egypt
was in that island finally organized.</p>

<p>During this time the English force in the Mediterranean
had been increased by the arrival of a body of 4000 men,
under Lord Dalhousie, from Belleisle, where they had at
first been intended to act. This reinforcement, with others
<span class="sidenote">Cust.</span>
which followed, brought Sir R. Abercromby’s force up to
17,489 men before it finally left Malta; and an additional
force of 6000 men, under Sir David Baird, was expected to
meet them from India. The story of the Expedition after
leaving Malta will be told in General Lawson’s own words.
But, in passing, it may be stated that Minorca was the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
residence at this time of Colonel Cuppage of the Artillery,
whose correspondence with the Deputy Adjutant-General
reveals the fact that he was allowed a power over the Royal
Artillery in the Mediterranean of a very extensive and
unusual description. As a rule, as little power as possible
was allowed to commanding officers on out-stations; the
movements of officers especially were carefully regulated
from England; but Colonel Cuppage evidently had the
power, and exercised it, of transferring officers and men
from companies, even belonging to different battalions,&mdash;of
appointing officers to the bomb service in the Mediterranean,
and of disembarking others already appointed; and, in a
word, of exercising unlimited control over that part of the
Regiment which came within the area of his command. This
is mentioned because such control, however advisable, was
rarely exercised by the Board, which was jealous of anything
approaching independence in those under its orders;&mdash;and
it is impossible to avoid expressing surprise that a system
which succeeded so admirably on this occasion did not
receive further trial. The fact of Minorca being the residence
of the Commanding Officer of Artillery must not be construed
as implying that the old Ordnance Establishment and Train,
which disappeared with the capitulation of Port Mahon in
1782, had been revived. His residence there was almost
accidental, and mainly on account of its convenience,&mdash;previous
to the capture of Malta,&mdash;as a rallying point for the
naval and military forces in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>One instance must be given, before entering upon General
Lawson’s narrative, to show how infamously the arrangements
of the civil branch of the Ordnance were often conducted,
after a campaign had been undertaken, and how scandalously
the shortcomings of the <i>civil</i> were left to be expiated by the
<i>military</i> branch. These instances will be frequent as this
work proceeds, and they are reproduced with a double and
deliberate purpose: first, to show under what difficulties our
armies obtained their successes; and second, to remind those
who are ever ready to criticise the slightest shortcoming
of the same description in the present day, that in our older
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
campaigns, whose glories are remembered when their
blunders are forgotten, the faults which are deprecated so
loudly to-day existed in an appalling degree.</p>

<p>Major Cookson’s company was the first of General Lawson’s
force to leave Portsmouth. The earliest report of its movements
is a letter written by Major Cookson from the Island
of Houat, where he found 132 of the 6th Battalion, making,
with his own company, a total force of Artillery amounting
to 227 of all ranks. With characteristic energy, he commenced,
after landing his company, to improve and strengthen
his position. The reader will be good enough to remember
that Major Cookson’s company was one of those, on the
equipment of which the Board had expended unusual energy;
and had felt such confidence in the omniscience of their <i>civil</i>
officials, that they would not even reply to the hints and
prayers of the officers of Artillery, who were most deeply
interested. Doubtless, then, everything will be found as it
should be. Yet let us hear what Major Cookson reports:
<span class="sidenote">Major
Cookson,
from I. of
Houat,
24 June,
1800.</span>
“I have only a moment to tell you how very much distressed
I am; and how much the Service is retarded for
want of a <i>Clerk of Stores</i> who understands his duty.
There is a man here who calls himself Conductor of Stores,
but he is very far from being adequate to the situation,
being, in the first place, <i>incapable of writing</i>.... I have
16 pieces of ordnance under my charge (10 6-pounders
and 6 howitzers), all of which I had to complete to 100
rounds each, on board of the different vessels they were
in, and to mount them ready to land in a <i>chasse-marée</i>,
which was cut down and prepared for the purpose, and
which I got done in two days; since which I have been
obliged to land some here, and to put others from the
‘Diadem’ and ‘Inconstant’ on board the ‘John’ ordnance
ship, and into boats. Conceive, then, how much I must have
been in want of conductors and clerks of stores! On
board the ‘John,’ when in a hurry for completing the
ammunition, we were much annoyed to find <i>12-pounder
flannel cartridges for the 5½-inch howitzers</i>, and other like
mistakes; however, I <i>set the women to work</i> and got over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
that difficulty and many others.... <i>All the camp equipage
for the officers and men whom I brought out is deficient</i>;
do, pray, therefore, send me out the camp equipage for
my company ... with a hospital and laboratory tent,
as soon as you possibly can; as also camp-kettles, canteens,
and haversacks. The whole of the men have been uncommonly
harassed for some days past.”</p>

<p>This is a charming picture of official foresight, and one
which we shall find painted again and again in the succeeding
pages of English story. Blind to the fact that the men, who
were to use them, were also the best judges of the things
required and&mdash;

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Being too blind to have desire to see,”<br /></span>
</span></span>

the civil branch of the Ordnance too often reasoned <i>à priori</i>&mdash;evolved
out of its own consciousness certain ill-defined
wants, which the troops might possibly have&mdash;and, with many
blunders and shortcomings, endeavoured to meet them. And
then, with monotonous recurrence, came a pitiful struggle to
maintain its own dignity in the face of incessant failure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Major
Cookson,
from
Houat,
1 August,
1800.</div>

<p>That the response to Major Cookson’s appeal was not wholly
satisfactory may be gathered from the following extract from
a subsequent letter:&mdash;“Conceive,” he wrote, “their sending
me a common soldiers’ tent for the sick, and five horsemen’s
tents <i>without their poles</i>, which to obtain here would be impossible,
as all the men-of-war have expended already
every inch of wood that could be spared. You will see by
the return that we have 50 men ill, and, I am sorry to say,
several of them dangerously so.”</p>

<p>It is a relief to turn, now, to the words of a man eminently
capable of removing the difficulties with which he was
surrounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brig.-Gen.
Lawson,
R.A.,
MSS. Narrative
in
R. A. Library.</div>

<p>“The Expedition, under the orders of Admiral Lord Keith
and General Abercromby, proceeded from the Island of
Malta on the 21st December, 1800, arrived at Marmorice
Bay, in Asia Minor, on the New Year’s Day following, and
remained there, waiting the co-operation of the Turks
(being the time of their Ramadan), until the 20th February.
During this period every measure was taken the situation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
admitted of to lessen the numerous difficulties expected to
be met with in Egypt,&mdash;such as a dangerous shore to land
upon&mdash;a country destitute of wood, water, or roads&mdash;where
(as the Commander-in-Chief informed the General Officers,
assembled by order) nothing was to be looked for but a
wild waste of desert, and obstacles which the most unremitting
exertions had only a chance of surmounting, independent
of a formidable opposition from the French troops.</p>

<p>“Under these ideas, and the battering train (originally
designed against Belleisle only) having joined the army
very indifferently provided indeed for such an uncommon,
arduous enterprise, no time could be lost. All the artificers
were landed, and strong working parties sent into the
woods to cut down timber for making additional spars,
skids, and various-sized rollers, to form gangways for
landing the heavy ordnance upon, assisting them over deep
sandy beaches, and in crossing the canals formed for conveying
the rising waters of the Nile into the towns and
cultivated spots of the country.</p>

<p>“The generally acknowledged difficulty of travelling by
wheeled carriages in Egypt induced the trial of a number of
contrivances to lessen that evil also, the first of which were
a kind of litters,... termed ‘horse-barrows.’ No wood
growing in this country proper for such purposes, rendered
it necessary to dig saw-pits, in order to cut the pine timber
into long scantling (16 feet in length, and about 4 inches
square), something near the shape of a common hand-barrow,
preserving the grain as entire as possible. Two
movable cross-bars, which are secured by two small bolts,
keep these shafts at a proper interval, to admit a horse at
each end between them. Each horse or mule had a small
cart saddle with girth, back-band, breastplate, and crupper,
and a halter for leading it by. These barrows were particularly
useful for narrow paths and the trenches of
an attack, or for conveying any individual weight too
heavy for a single horse, such as a small piece of ordnance,
standing carriage, large casks of provisions, &amp;c. (The
powder and ammunition expended at the attack of Aboukir
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
Castle were mostly conveyed from the landing-place to the
batteries in this manner.) Besides these single barrows, a
design was formed for double ones, consisting of three
shafts, to be carried by four horses in pairs; and also
others upon a still larger scale for camels, but neither time
nor materials admitted of their being put into immediate
execution. A very considerable number of carrying-poles,
about 9 feet long each, were formed out of the small-sized
trees, to which rope-slings were added, for the soldiers to
convey kegs of musket-ball cartridges, ammunition-boxes,
or royal mortars with.</p>

<p>“A number of horses were purchased at Constantinople
on the part of the English Government, and sent to Marmorice,
for remounting the Light Dragoons, and those
rejected by them were turned over to the Artillery service.
Such poor undersized animals as they were rendered it
absolutely necessary not only to take the harness entirely
to pieces, in order to bring it anything near fitting them,
but also to lay aside all the heavy parts, such as neck-collars,
chain-traces, curb-bits, &amp;c., and replace them with
light leather breast-collars, rope-traces, and pads formed out
of the waggon harness, a great part of which, fortunately,
was not likely to be otherwise called for.</p>

<p>“About 130 horses being thus completed with harness,
some light pieces&mdash;guns and howitzers&mdash;were landed, and
a small park formed, in order to drill them to the draught.
Every reform possible was made to lighten the travelling
of the ordnance, and it was very much wished to have
exchanged the limber-shafts for poles also, on account of
their weight, as well as other considerations; but no proper
wood could then be procured&mdash;even at the Island of Rhodes&mdash;for
the purpose. The clock-trailed light 6-pounder carriages
had ten horses allotted to each for draught; but
the framed ones required twelve when going over heavy
sand or shingle.</p>

<p>“A few of the most useful horse-artillery manœuvres were
also practised here, it being the Commander-in-Chiefs
intention to establish some pieces on that principle whenever
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
horses could be procured for it. Drivers were also
very much wanted, several of those which came out originally
with the battering train having, with their officer,
returned, in a very unaccountable manner, from Lisbon to
England, after the attempt on Cadiz.</p>

<p>“The following considerations were submitted to the Commander-in-Chief
at Marmorice Bay, on 10th Jan., 1801<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“1st. As the passage of the fleet to the coast of Egypt
may probably be short, it is humbly proposed to have the
light field-pieces of the first division of troops conveyed
from hence on the decks of the ships of war, so as to be
at once lowered down altogether into the boats, having
their Artillery detachments along with them, without the
necessity of any other preparation after coming to anchor.</p>

<p>“2nd. The ordnance ships, in which the other pieces next
for landing are aboard, to be conducted and stationed by
the agent himself (the masters alone not being sufficient
at such a crisis) as near to the shore as safety will admit.
And it will be necessary, on account of the crowded
manner in which they were loaded in England (being taken
upon freight), to have light vessels alongside of them to
receive the water-casks, and articles not immediately
wanted, in clearing away to those sought for.</p>

<p>“3rd. Small vessels or decked boats, with field ammunition
and musket-ball cartridges, will be required (particularly
if the coast proves shallow) still nearer in shore,
and to be stationed opposite the centre of attack immediately
after the landing of the first division of the troops,
distinguished by Ordnance Jacks. In order to furnish the
most speedy supply possible, a number of hand-carts and
carrying-poles may be thrown on shore from these boats,
for the soldiers to take off any ammunition wanting, until
the horses can be landed.</p>

<p>“4th. The flat boats and launches of the ships of war are
wished to be employed in carrying the field ordnance, &amp;c.,
ashore, instead of transports’ long-boats, which (as was
experienced at Cadiz), from their want of hands and
general size, are quite inadequate to the business.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

<p>“5th. Planks, joined together lengthways by staples and
cordage, may be necessary to travel the carriages upon over
the heavy sands. The French, it is said, made use of raw
hides in passing the deserts with their field-pieces. Perhaps
lengths of rope, about 30 feet each, with narrow netting
between to receive the wheels upon, might be found
as useful, and, in our situation, more readily procured.</p>

<p>“6th. One thousand seamen, provided with drag-ropes or
harness, will be required to assist in landing and drawing
up the heavy ordnance and stores.</p>

<p>“7th. The mode of advancing into the country will depend
upon the means of draught found there; but, at all events,
if a strong detachment of seamen can be procured to remain
with the Artillery, it will be highly beneficial to service.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Agreeable to these representations, application was immediately
made to Lord Keith, who consented to take
aboard each of the line-of-battle ships two field-pieces,
which were placed on the poops ready for lowering down
into the launches all together. Twenty-five seamen and
officers were allotted to each piece, with fifteen of the
Artillery. These 350 were all the seamen his Lordship
could spare out of the 1000 demanded. Two general
rehearsals of landing were then practised: the guns got
ashore very readily, and <i>quicker than the troops could leap
out of their boats</i>. Each ship-of-war formed its own boat’s
gangway; the best of them was made out of the fishing
of a mast, which, being hollow, secured the wheels of the
carriage from slipping, without side-pieces.”</p>

<p><i>Alterations made in Carronade Carriages.</i>&mdash;“The moving
of heavy ordnance over the deserts of Egypt the French
thought impracticable, and attempted no larger calibre
than 8-pounders or 12-pounders. Something more, however,
seemed necessary for us to make trial of against an
enemy so much more formidable than any they had had to
contend with, independent of the ambition of superior
resource. Upon comparing all circumstances together, it
appeared likely that whatever works they might have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
raised in the interior of the country since their possession
of it, could not be very solid ones, even if composed of
masonry, for want of time to settle and the cement to
harden sufficiently in such substances; and earth alone, in
this climate, must soon crumble to dust or sand, and easily
be destroyed by shells. From these considerations it was
concluded that carronades might probably be found sufficiently
powerful to breach them in either case at moderate
distances, and be easily conveyed by the double horse or
camel-barrow across the country if necessary. The circumstance
being suggested to Sir Ralph Abercromby, and,
at the same time, the means proposed of altering the
carriages for this purpose without affecting their sea-service
in the smallest degree, His Excellency communicated
the idea to Lord Keith, who immediately ordered
several of these 24-pounder carriages (though larger
ones were wished for) ashore from the ships-of-war, to
undergo the necessary alteration. This operation being
soon executed, some trials of shot and shells were made
there, and afterwards aboard the ‘Foudroyant,’ in presence
of the Admiral and the General, and much approved of.”</p>

<p>For the information of the non-professional reader, it may
here be mentioned that carronades are far lighter than guns
of the same calibre. The details by which General Lawson
describes, in his MSS., the modifications made by him to
render the carronade-carriages suitable for his purpose, are
illustrated by carefully-prepared diagrams, without which
the description would hardly be intelligible. It may be
stated briefly that, by certain additions to the carriage&mdash;which
could easily be removed when again wanted on board
ship&mdash;he produced something akin to the modern dwarf
traversing platform, requiring little or no ground platform
on which to be traversed. The navy officers who were present
at the experiments expressed their opinion that the
alteration would be very useful to their service also, for
taking up posts occasionally ashore.</p>

<p>The MS. proceeds next to describe the arrangements made
by General Lawson.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>“Many mistakes, as well as loss of time, happening on
service by the ammunition being sent into the field with
the waggons accompanying the guns in the same state as
lodged in the storehouses; that is, round shot, case shot,
cartridges, and small stores, each article in separate packing-boxes,
it was thought advisable, especially on this
occasion, where the ammunition must be mostly carried on
camels’ backs, to complete each individual box with a
certain number of rounds (one fourth case), including small
stores, and everything necessary to the firing of them.
This was effected by only raising the round-shot packing-case
about two inches higher, and the addition of a small
board as a false bottom, which admitted of stowings as follows,
viz., for light 6-pounders, 15 rounds and a extra case-shot;
light 12-pounders, 8 rounds; medium 12-pounders,
7 rounds. For the royal howitzer ammunition, it was
necessary to have two packing-boxes on this principle,
viz., one containing 9 live shells and 1 case-shot; the
other with 2 case-shot and all the articles for firing
12 rounds complete. This mode was found extremely
useful in the field, and is strongly recommended for all
immediate occasions of service, as no possible mistake
can then happen, either from ignorance or neglect, in
supplying the guns or limber-boxes with the utmost
expedition.</p>

<p>“The ammunition for field-service was usually conveyed
on camels’ backs, each carrying four of the altered
6-pounder packing-boxes, two on each side, in a sort of
netted bag thrown over a pack-saddle; but, useful as these
animals are generally for great weights, there are inconveniences
attending them in this particular service; viz.,
when loaded (which, of course, must be daily repeated)
they move very slowly, therefore quite unfit for Horse
Artillery;&mdash;in order to load or unload, they must first be
made to kneel down, which in an action they are not
always inclined to, and sometimes become very refractory
and unmanageable; also, whatever quantity of ammunition
is required for the gun must always be taken equally from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
both sides at the same time, to preserve its equilibrium,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>“These reasons determined a trial of light carriages in
their stead, first beginning with royal howitzer ammunition,
it being the most dangerous and liable to injury.
Some of the hand-carts were selected for this purpose, and,
in order to travel the better, converted to curricles. The
poles were accordingly lengthened, and cross-bars fixed to
support them in front of the horses’ collars, much in the
same manner as the 3-pounder carriages formerly used in
the Horse Artillery, only more simplified. These carriages
were drawn by four horses each, and went through all the
marches of the army to and from Grand Cairo remarkably
well, travelling very rapidly with 48 rounds of the howitzer
ammunition completed for immediate service, as
already mentioned.”</p>

<p><i>Light 3-pounder Carriages altered for Cavalry.</i>&mdash;“Our
Cavalry, from their want of proper horses, being found
very unequal to the capitally-mounted French dragoons,
it became necessary to aid that defect by the attachment
of Artillery. Four light 3-pounders (brought from Malta)
were first prepared for this service. Their original mode
of travelling with shafts and single line of draught was
altered to a double one by cutting off the shafts of the
limber at the cross-bar, and introducing a pole instead of
them, together with other improvements. (For example,
a block of wood was fixed by two bolts to the back of the
axletree, and the iron pintail removed from the centre of
it to this block to receive the trail of the carriage upon.
This was done in order to make room for a 6-pounder
ammunition-box, to be fixed crossways in the front. The
old side-boxes belonging to the carriage being rejected
entirely, <i>their places furnished seats for two gunners</i>. At
small expense an ammunition-box, containing 8 rounds,
was made to fit in between the cheeks of the gun-carriage,
after the French manner. <i>A copper tray or drawer was
introduced under one of the gunners’ seats to contain the slowmatch,
instead of carrying a lintstock.</i>) Four or six horses,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
with two drivers (according to the ground), drew the
carriage. These pieces were served by four Artillerymen,
<i>two on the carriage and two mounted on the off draught-horses</i>.
They went through the service to Grand Cairo,
and travelled much better than was expected from the
lowness of the limber-wheels, which defect there was no
remedy for in Egypt.</p>

<p>“Four light 6-pounders upon block-trail carriages, with
two royal howitzers, were also equipped (as nearly as the
means would admit) for Horse Artillery service. Seven
Artillerymen and three drivers, with ten horses, were
allotted for the service of each piece, the gunners riding
the horses in draught, but the non-commissioned officer
mounted single for the purpose of advancing to examine
roads, reconnoitring the enemy, &amp;c. These block-trail
carriages, from their lightness, short draught, and quick
turning, passed over the inundation dykes and desert with
great ease, while the framed carriages with more horses
were attended with difficulty and delay, and once in the
desert, were obliged to be left behind.</p>

<p>“The success of the curricle carts (for field ammunition)
induced a trial if something might not be done with the
waggons also, hitherto looked upon as out of all question,
except the local duties of the park. Some of them were
taken to pieces, and all the heaviest parts laid aside&mdash;that
is, the bolsters, sides, and shafts. The bottoms were then
contracted both in length and breadth, so as just to receive
nine or ten of the altered packing-cases only. The hoops
were lowered, and the painted covers made to fit exactly.
Poles were used instead of shafts, and the usual swingle
trees reduced fewer in number. The rejected parts being
weighed, no less than six hundred pounds appeared saved
in the draught by this simple operation, and a larger
proportion of ammunition conveyed by it at the same time
with less labour. The immense weight and bulk of the
platform and devil carriages rendered them totally useless;
some of these altered waggons were substituted as a
light class of the former kind, by taking away the bottoms
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
entirely, and fixing in their stead a couple of very strong
planks to each, with an interval between them resembling
the original. These light platform carriages proved very
useful in withdrawing the ordnance and stores from our
lines across very heavy sands for re-embarkation.”</p>

<p>The next subject treated of in the MS. is “Heavy weights
raised without a Gin,” as follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The two-wheeled trench-cart (of which there were
luckily a number on the Expedition) is a most useful
little carriage for carrying articles of moderate bulk to a
ton in weight; indeed, even so far as 10-inch iron mortar-beds
of 23 cwt. were transported in them, but in these
cases it was necessary, of course, to make use of a gin
also. To obviate this circumstance and render the cart of
more independent utility, an inclined plane was attached
to the rear of it, and a small windlass fixed in the front,
with a rope and iron block hooked to the weight, having
rollers to ease the purchase, the weight being thus brought
up on the cart by turning the windlass. By this simple
means six men were sufficient to mount upon the cart,
and deliver at a battery any article the strength of the
axletree and wheels could bear, without making the
appearance or drawing the attention of the enemy, which
such large machines as devil carriages and sling carts
constantly do, besides taking into consideration the vast
difference, in point of weight, between these carriages in
themselves. Another considerable advantage is that this
contrivance is only occasionally applied, and the cart may
be immediately worked in its original capacity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Narrow
wheels
prevented
from sinking
in the
sand.</div>

<p>“It being apprehended that extraordinary heavy weights
might cause the low, narrow wheels of the trenched cart
to sink so much into the sand as to retard the draught
considerably, a contrivance was thought of to prevent
this from happening, by occasionally increasing the
breadth of the fellies. The staves of casks being strong,
and of a favourable shape for the purpose, and still more
valuable from their being easily procured at the Commissary-General’s
store, it was proposed to cut them into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
lengths of seven or nine inches each piece, having two
small iron staples fixed at an interval, the breadth of the
<i>felley</i>. A rope equal in length to the circumference of the
wheel is run through each of these lines of staples, secured
so as not to slip out, but keep the staves parallel at one
inch and a half asunder. They are then applied to the
wheels, and fixed by small lashings to the spokes, to keep
the whole from any alteration in travelling.”</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Some Remarks on the foregoing Articles.</h3>

<p>1st. “The original intention of the Expedition did not
appear to have Egypt for its object, and for a considerable
while was very inauspicious. In the first instance it
proved too late to be any use to the Austrians in Italy,
and afterwards became unsuccessful at Cadiz. Much time
appeared to be lost before it reached the <i>rendezvous</i> at
Marmorice Bay; and it was then thought by the Turks a
very unseasonable part of the year for any attempt on the
coast of Egypt, besides which it happened to be the time of
their Ramadan, when no operations of any kind are undertaken
by them. This last delay, however, although much
regretted, turned out advantageous to the future proceedings
of the army. Some useful arrangements were made
then, besides the opportunity it gave of landing the sick
after a long confinement on board ship, by which many
recovered; and the Island of Rhodes, just in the neighbourhood,
afforded hospitals for the remainder.”</p>

<p>2nd. “All the field ordnance, which had been landed at
Ferrol with Lieutenant-General Sir James Pulteney’s
army, and afterwards joined General Sir Ralph Abercromby,
were re-embarked there in so disorderly a manner
that no one piece was found fit for immediate service.
This circumstance will for ever unfortunately occur, <i>unless
the direction of the business is left entirely to the Artillery
Corps</i>, whether navy boats and ships of war or those of
the Ordnance only receive them. It cannot be expected
that the navy officers are in the first place fully acquainted
with the real importance of keeping all the parts of such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
carriages, ammunition-boxes, &amp;c., exactly sorted together,
or that they can bestow much consideration on the subject,
hurried as they generally are upon such occasions.”</p>

<p>3rd. “The turning over only rejected horses from the
Dragoons to the Artillery services was not so well judged
as might be expected. It would have been fortunate (the
best of theirs bearing no comparison with the French
cavalry) to have rendered the movement of the Ordnance
more effectual; as it was, both corps remained insufficient;
the effects of which were fully experienced in the action
of the 13th March, when, had only a part of the number
of pieces then in the field been very well horsed, the fate
of Alexandria (it is more than probable) might have been
decided on that day. The French, on the other hand,
<i>constantly applied the very prime of their strong horses
(those belonging to the officers not excepted) to the draught of
their ordnance</i>, which were chiefly on the Horse Artillery
establishment, with 8-pounder guns and 6-inch howitzers,
opposed to light 6-pounders and royals only.”</p>

<p>4th. “The disembarking of ordnance, unless in the
instance of field-pieces let down into the boats ready
mounted from ships of war, however regularly performed,
is always liable to some confusion. This principally arises
from the parts of the same natures of carriages not corresponding
so correctly as they might do, particularly in the
diameters of the wheels and arms of the axletrees, which
should likewise be as general throughout the whole as
possible. The waggons and carts being frequently made
by contract, are very defective in these points, even to the
fitting of their head and tail-boards; and, trifling as this
may appear to a workman at home, it often occasions
delays of consequence to the service, or credit of those
concerned in it abroad. No nation, in point of economy
alone, requires so much attention to the construction and
solid stowage of its military carriages and stores as Great
Britain does, on account of their frequent embarkations,
the expenses of which in the course of a war are prodigiously
great.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>5th. “The considerations submitted to the Commander-in-Chief
respecting the first landing of the ordnance and
stores, were much approved, and happily executed with
great despatch, notwithstanding some very serious impediments,
arising from the manner of loading the ships <i>by
freight</i> (carrying as much as possible without order), instead
of being regularly assorted. The embarking troops also on
board such ships is always attended with, not only great
inconvenience, but considerable damage, from the quantity
of water necessary to carry for them, the waste and leakage
of which injures the carriages and stores considerably
underneath, besides the difficulty it occasions of getting at
them when required for service. In the preparations for
landing at Cadiz, seventy tons of water were obliged to be
first removed from one ship only. Great inconveniences
were also found from the magnitude of some of the ships,
which could not be brought within some miles of the shore.
They should for such services never exceed 600 tons, and
a moderate draught of water.”</p>

<p>6th. “Carronades might certainly be employed in the land
service to considerable advantage in many situations, particularly
on the flanks or firing over the parapets of fortifications
and for field-works in general. It would also be
very well worth while to have some experiments tried with
them in breaching walls and earthworks. The common
objection made to their shortness injuring the embrasures
has more of imagination than reality in it. They may be
advanced the extent of any gun mounted upon a travelling
carriage, and much farther than the largest garrison
howitzer, with less explosion of powder. If their present
carriages are found to recoil too far, it is easily checked by
only laying a few filled sand-bags upon them, and in the
rear, as was practised in Egypt with perfect success; or
it may be checked by small iron wedges with chains, placed
to receive the fore-trucks upon.”</p>

<p>7th. “The arrangement made of the spare field-ammunition
on the passage from Marmorice Bay to the coast of
Egypt was very fortunate, as it proved impossible to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
carried any quantity forward otherwise, for want of conveyance,
excepting a few camels taken from the enemy on
the first landing in Aboukir Bay.”</p>

<p>8th. “The 3-pounder light guns, patched up as they
were, gave considerable confidence to the Dragoons. This
calibre might be rendered very useful to Cavalry in general
by an increase of dimensions, to 4½ feet in length, and about
4 cwt. in weight, with carriages upon a quick travelling
construction, not overloaded with ammunition, which our
service is rather liable to.</p>

<p>“Foreigners frequently observe the singularity of shafts
being preferred in the British Artillery carriages to poles,
made use of by all other nations as being simpler, lighter,
and cheaper; added to which the experience of having travelled
over the most difficult features of Europe, and
ground of every description with them, fully evinces their
perfect sufficiency. A strong instance of the inconvenience
of shafts occurred to us at Rahmanich: just as one of the
6-pounders was limbering up, the shaft-horse was killed
by the enemy; much time was lost in clearing the carriage
from him, and the harness being also damaged, rendered
it difficult to apply another in his place.</p>

<p>“In the marching of the 12-pounders to Grand Cairo
(drawn by oxen with a horse in the shafts) the want of
double or travelling trunnion-boxes was much regretted.
Some few carriages were formerly so constructed for the
Horse Artillery, but why discontinued remains unknown,
as they are undoubtedly very advantageous to a heavy
draught or indifferent horses.</p>

<p>“In moving the 24-pounder guns across the country
from the first position near Cairo (where a bridge of boats
to communicate with the Grand Vizier’s army was thrown
over the Nile) for the attack of Gizeh, the axletrees of the
sling-carts giving way, the medium 12-pounder carriages
were appropriated to this purpose, the trench-carts carrying
the mortars, standing carriages, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>9th. “No carriage appears to want reform more than the
common Artillery waggon. There is too much of it merely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
for carrying ammunition, and it is too narrow for baggage
or bulky stores. In the alterations made for the proposed
arrangement of spare ammunition, the boxes will require
for hard roads to be more securely fixed than was necessary
for travelling in Egypt.”</p>

<p>10th. “The inclined plane, or purchase for raising weights
upon the trench-carts, might prove very useful, upon a
larger scale, for mounting or dismounting heavy ordnance
without being obliged to make use of a gin, which not
only requires a number of men to work, and a carriage to
convey it to a battery, but when fixed there becomes a
considerable object to the enemy besieged. This proposed
machine being quite free from all these inconveniences
makes it extremely well worth while to try the experiment
for such occasions.”</p>

<p>11th. “If the mode mentioned of preventing narrow
wheels from sinking in deep sandy situations should have
the appearance of possessing more fancy than judgment, it
must be placed to the variety of obstacles which hourly
presented themselves in Egypt, and called for every assistance
the mind could catch at to surmount. And still
perhaps the idea may lead to something useful even in a
northern climate, passing over snow, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>12th. ... “The extraordinary heavy weights of the
iron mortars and beds proved a great embarrassment
without any peculiar advantage derived from them.
Indeed, where no considerable extent of range is required&mdash;as
is the case in most attacks&mdash;brass mortars mounted
upon proportional iron beds seem in general much preferable,
at least under 13 inches in diameter....”</p>

<p>13th. “Flat boats are the best and most useful conveyance
for troops, and ordnance, possible; every means,
therefore, should be employed to preserve them from
injury. Though apparently slight, it is surprising what
they can bear. In moving the stores up Lake Etcho, for
the attack of Fort Julian, some of them were dragged three
miles over sand and mudbank. The battering-pieces for
this service were obliged to be landed on the open sea-beach,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
and conveyed four miles across the deserts and
swamps to their batteries. These laborious and difficult
operations were frequently repeated during the expedition.
Upwards of thirty 24-pounders were disembarked from
the ordnance ships, conveyed by boats up Aboukir Lake,
and landed near the head of it for the attack of Alexandria.
From thence twenty were returned to the ships
in Aboukir Bay, conveyed to the mouth of the western
branch of the Nile, disembarked and taken over that dangerous
bar by <i>sea-jerms</i>, landed at Fort St. Julian, re-embarked
there in <i>river-jerms</i>, in order to proceed up the
Nile. Several were landed within four miles of Grand
Cairo, and conveyed from thence twelve miles across the
country, for the attack of Gizeh;&mdash;returned back after the
surrender of Cairo by the same route, and exactly in like
manner to Alexandria;&mdash;relanded there for further operations
of attacks carrying on both on the eastern and
western side of it,&mdash;the capitulation of which concluding
the campaign, they were again conveyed to the ships in
Aboukir Bay.</p>

<p>“Besides the articles already detailed, numerous minute
circumstances happened in the course of the campaign,
which necessity continually urged the imagination to
provide against. Every movement by land or water
was attended with infinite labour and difficulties;
added to which the violent heat of the sun, and shocks
received by passing over the formidable cracks it occasioned
in the ground (annually overflowed by the
Nile) on the march to Cairo operated so powerfully on
the carriages, as to require perpetual attention and daily
repair&mdash;without the most common materials for such
occasions, either of wood or iron, to be found in the
country.</p>

<p>“N.B. The oxen drew very well upon common ground,
but in deep sand they generally became restive. The
large-sized mules were excellent in draught when well-disposed;
but, from their natural obstinacy, it was found
best to intermix them with horses.”

<blockquote>

<p>N.B.&mdash;Besides the above, the French were allowed to embark 50 field-pieces
from Cairo, and 10 from Alexandria.</p></blockquote>

<p>The extremely interesting notes just quoted, although
relating more to questions of <i>matériel</i> than <i>personnel</i>, still
give a clear idea of the difficulties attending the movements
of the Artillery in Egypt, the overcoming of which was no
less honourable, if, indeed, not more so, than their marked
courage in the field. In alluding to the latter, a very brief
sketch of the campaign will suffice.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 8th March, 1801, the English
army disembarked in Aboukir Bay under a heavy fire, and
drove back the French with a loss of five guns. On the 13th
the severe action known as the affair of Nicopolis took
place, in which the French were again defeated, but not
<span class="sidenote">Cust.</span>
without a loss to the English of 1300, killed and wounded.
The siege of Aboukir Castle followed, the bombardment
<span class="sidenote">Browne.</span>
being conducted by Major Cookson, and it surrendered on
the 19th. On the 21st, the memorable battle of Alexandria
was fought,&mdash;memorable not merely for its victorious result,
but also for the irreparable loss which the English army
suffered in the death of Sir R. Abercromby. The conduct
of the Artillery in the battle attracted great attention; the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
<span class="sidenote">Stewart’s
‘Highlanders
of Scotland.’</span>
precision of their fire was strongly commended, and, but for
the wretched animals with which the guns were horsed, an
advance of the army might have then taken place, which
would have ensured the immediate fall of Alexandria.
<span class="sidenote">Browne.</span>
Lieutenants H. Sturgeon, J. G. Burslem, and D. Campbell,
of the Royal Artillery, were wounded. The battle had been
waged mainly on the right of the English army, and before
the end of the day the ammunition of both Artillery and
Cavalry on the English right was all but exhausted, so much
so that “on an attempt of the French to advance anew
against this flank, the soldiers of the 28th actually
<span class="sidenote">Cust.</span>
pelted them with stones.” Unfortunately for the modern
Artilleryman, General Lawson was a very bad correspondent
during the war; and when the student commences anxiously
to search for his despatches to the Ordnance, he finds,
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Macleod to
General
Lawson.</span>
instead, indignant remonstrances addressed to the gallant
General for his silence. He was so occupied with overcoming
the natural difficulties of the expedition, that he had
no time for writing; and he valued no words of commendation,
which were spoken with regard to his services, so much
as those referring to the chief engineer and himself, which
formed part of a despatch written by General Hutchinson,
<span class="sidenote">‘London
Gazette,’
22 October,
1801.</span>
the successor of Sir R. Abercromby:&mdash;“The skill and perseverance
of those two officers have overcome difficulties
which at first appeared almost insurmountable.”</p>

<p>The arrival of a Turkish division, 6000 strong, to support
him, on the 3rd April, 1801, induced General Hutchinson,
who succeeded Sir R. Abercromby in the command, to carry
the war farther up the Nile, instead of waiting before
Alexandria. He commenced with some detached operations:
Rosetta surrendered on the 8th, and Fort St. Julian, after
<span class="sidenote">Browne’s
‘England’s
Artillerymen.’</span>
a bombardment, on the 19th. “On the 18th April a mortar
battery, erected against Fort St. Julian, under the direction
of Captains Lemoine and Duncan, fired some shells
with remarkable accuracy: one of them pitched on the
centre of the roof, and tore away the flagstaff and colours,
which the French never dared to erect again.”</p>

<p>The great events of the campaign were the surrender of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
Cairo on the 28th June, 1801, and of Alexandria on the 2nd
September. It was during the march on Cairo that the
ingenuity and endurance of the Royal Artillery were most
severely tried. Other writers have borne testimony&mdash;in
glowing, but not exaggerated terms&mdash;to the gallantry of
the other arms of the service in this campaign; and it must
not be assumed that the necessary allusions to a particular
corps in a work like this imply any assertion of superiority;
such conduct would be at once unjust, and subversive of the
main purpose of this history. There are regiments, the
very mention of whose names brings instinctively to the
hearer’s memory the brave story of Egypt; but, where all
were brave, the special professional duties of Artillerymen
obtained for those, who served in that capacity, opportunities
of displaying energy and ingenuity which were denied
to others. There have been campaigns where the exertions
of the Infantry have dwarfed those of the other arms; there
have been occasions&mdash;sung by poets, and boasted of with
just pride by all Englishmen&mdash;when the honour of England
was entrusted to her Cavalry, and was brought back with redoubled
lustre; it is, therefore, in no spirit of depreciation of
the other arms that the services of the Artillery are especially
pointed out, during a campaign where the hardest work was
not in battle, and in a work which hopes to hand down to
their successors the merits of those who, in Egypt, were
responsible for their Regiment’s reputation. It is with such
a hope that words like the following, referring to the siege
<span class="sidenote">Stewart’s
‘Highlanders
of Scotland.’</span>
of Alexandria, are reproduced:&mdash;“The proceedings against
Alexandria showed to what a pitch of perfection the
British Artillery had arrived. The battery on the Greenhill
opened at six o’clock on the morning of the 26th
August, and before mid-day the enemy were completely
silenced, their batteries destroyed, and their guns withdrawn.
On the west of Alexandria, the tower of Marabout
was bombarded from a battery commanded by Captain
Curry,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> of the Royal Artillery. The first shot struck the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
tower, four feet from the ground; every succeeding shot
struck the same spot; and in this manner he continued,
never missing his mark, till a large hole was in a manner
completely bored through, when the building fell, and,
filling up the surrounding ditch, the place was instantly
surrendered.”</p>

<p>At the surrender of Cairo no fewer than 13,754 French
were present, and were allowed to evacuate Egypt; and at
Alexandria, where General Menou, the French Commander,
<span class="sidenote">Cust.</span>
was stationed,&mdash;11,000 French soldiers, exclusive of civilians,
surrendered to the English. In a campaign which lasted only
from March to September, the power of the French in Egypt,
and even their presence, disappeared. Prior to the capitulation
of General Menou, he made a strong effort to drive the
English from before Alexandria. This took place on the
22nd August, and in the general orders issued after the
engagement the following words appeared:&mdash;“The brunt of
the day fell on the Artillery, under the command of Major
Cookson, and the advance corps, who used every exertion,
and showed much discipline.” It is also mentioned by a
<span class="sidenote">Browne,
author of
‘England’s
Artillerymen.’</span>
writer often quoted in these pages, whose industry becomes
more and more apparent the more his work is studied, that
“the celerity with which the guns at the siege of Alexandria
had been brought up was a remarkable instance of zeal,
as they had to be carried over almost inaccessible rocks.”</p>

<p>Two events occurred during the campaign, which deserve
mention. A contingent of troops arrived from India under
Sir David Baird, including some of the East India Company’s
Artillery. The first instalment arrived on the 10th June,
and was present at the surrender of Cairo by the French;
and Sir David, with the main body, arrived in sufficient
time to witness the successful termination of the siege of
Alexandria, and with it the conclusion of the war.</p>

<p>The second event involves some explanation. In 1798 a
detachment of the Royal Artillery was ordered to Turkey to
assist in the instruction and organization of the Turkish
Artillery, and in the strengthening of their fortifications.
The officer in command was Brigadier-General Koehler, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
had as a subaltern attracted attention during the great
Siege of Gibraltar, and who had been almost continuously
employed on the Staff of the army since that time. The
Artillery officers who accompanied him were Majors Hope
and Fead, Captain Martin Leake, and Assistant-Surgeon
Wittman. The duties of these officers, as far as can be
learned from the correspondence which is extant, were of a
somewhat motley order,&mdash;embracing artillery, engineering,
archæology, and military organization. Their travels in
Turkey, Greece, Syria, and Egypt were very extensive; and
if we may judge from a quaint manuscript in the Royal
Artillery Record Office, describing a journey made by them
to Jerusalem, they must have travelled as royal personages.
General Koehler died on the 29th December, 1800, of a
malignant fever, which had carried off his wife and many of
his detachment; and the regret and positive grief, which
were felt by English and Turks alike, were strongly expressed
<span class="sidenote">Major
Hope, R.A.,
to D. A.
General,
January
1801.</span>
in Major Hope’s reports to England. After his
death, Major Hope, with the remainder of the detachment,
accompanied the Grand Vizier and the Turkish contingent,
which went to Egypt to swell the English forces, and
earned well-deserved praise before Cairo, where the union
between them and the latter took place. Major Hope’s
abilities as an Artilleryman received favourable mention from
the Grand Vizier. After the conclusion of the campaign,
Captain Leake obtained special employment in the Turkish
dominions, and that he attained no mean position in the
scientific and literary world may be gathered from the

Colonel Leake passed from us, after a short and
sudden illness. His intellect never weakened; his
energies scarcely relaxed, notwithstanding the weight
of eighty-three years. The Greek minister, at his own
desire, followed him to the grave, expressing thereby the
gratitude of his country to one who had spared no effort on
behalf of the Greek nationality, and had done so much
by his works towards elucidating the remarkable features
of the land of Greece, and the scenes of her glorious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
history. In him we have lost not only a scholar and an
antiquary, but one other link (when so few survived) that
connected us to the politics, the literature, and the society
of the foregone generation.”</p>

<p>On the 16th November, 1801, an order was issued for the
withdrawal of the companies from Egypt, under which
Captain Beevor’s company of the 3rd Battalion, and Captain
Cookson’s, Major Sprowle’s, and Captain Wood’s of the 5th,
returned to England; and Major Borthwick’s, Captain
Lemoine’s, and Captain Adye’s proceeded to Gibraltar.
Major Borthwick remained in command of his company
during the war, although, by the records of the 2nd Battalion,
to which it belonged, Captain Mudge had been posted to
it some time previously, an appointment which must have
been subsequently cancelled, doubtless owing to his being
employed by Government on the Trigonometrical Survey of
Great Britain. In this occupation he was engaged during
the greater part of his life, and his admirable conduct of the
survey procured for him numerous literary and scientific
distinctions.</p>

<p>Among the officers of artillery who received special mention
for their services in Egypt, besides General Lawson,
<span class="sidenote">Kane’s List.</span>
were Major Cookson, who, in addition to receiving high
praise in general orders and despatches, was appointed, on
the 29th October, 1801, commandant of the ancient Pharos
Castle and of all the Artillery in Egypt, and was presented
with a gold medal by the Grand Vizier; Captains Lemoine,
A. Duncan, and S. G. Adye. Major Thompson, who had
received brevet rank of Colonel during the war, died of
wounds received on the 9th May, 1801, near Ramanieh;
and it should be mentioned that General Lawson himself was
severely wounded at the battle of Alexandria.</p>

<p>By General orders of 31st October and 1st November,
1803, the officers, non-commissioned officers, and men of the
various companies which had served in Egypt were permitted
to wear the “Sphynx,” with the word “Egypt” on
their regimental caps; but the distinction was a <i>personal</i>
one, and not to be perpetuated in the companies. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
regiments of the Line the distinction is perpetuated by
emblazonment on their colours. Although, however, the
decoration itself was but personal, the traditions of the
deeds which it commemorated are the inheritance of the
batteries, whose predecessors fought under the shadow of
the Pyramids. Let them treasure the memories of gallantry
and of difficulties overcome, and in the hours of their
own toils and dangers let them “remember Egypt.”</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">So</span> many important events will demand detailed notice presently,
that this chapter must be confined to a bare
statement of facts, necessary to keep the chain of the Regimental
history complete. The circumstances, under which
the Royal Irish Artillery was incorporated as the 7th
<span class="sidenote">Vol. i. pp.
163 &amp; 417.</span>
Battalion of the Regiment, have already been mentioned.
No sooner had the amalgamation taken place, than a questionable
step was taken by the authorities at the Ordnance:
they ordered the 5th Battalion to proceed to Ireland, and
relieve the 7th; and the six companies of the 7th Battalion,
which were serving in their native land, were promptly
shipped off to the West Indies to relieve the companies of
the 1st, 2nd, and 4th Battalions. This instant use of the
new battalion to garrison an unpleasant station can hardly
have had a conciliatory effect; and doubtless the sudden and
unpleasant change of quarters awakened occasional doubts
as to the value of the Union&mdash;in a military point of view,&mdash;if
not occasional mental growlings on the subject of
“Justice to Ireland,” among those who had to exchange
the pleasures of Dublin for the disadvantages of the tropics.
Be this as it may, in 1802 the new battalion was ordered
to the West Indies.</p>

<p>The arrangements of the Board for the reliefs of the
companies at this time reveal a very distinct attempt to
secure, as far as possible, that companies of the same battalion
should serve on the same station. For example, it
was decided that, in 1803, the whole of the companies at
Gibraltar should belong to the 6th Battalion; that the 1st
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
and 2nd Battalions should be collected in England; the
5th in Ireland; and that the detached commands, and the
wants of Canada should be supplied by the 3rd and 4th Battalions.
The scheme was marred by an occasional company
of a battalion, which it was hoped to concentrate, being
found to be at the Cape of Good Hope, or Ceylon; but the
effort was honestly made, and with the best intentions. That
it utterly failed during the tempest of war, which was so
soon and so long to rage, was not the fault of those who
hoped to produce a very different state of affairs; but the
result of inevitable causes. The American War had proved
the inconvenience of a battalion’s head-quarters being on the
scene of hostilities: the lesson was accepted, and the various
head-quarters were located at Woolwich; and therefore,
the fact having been once admitted that the necessary control
could be exercised, at a distance, over an individual company,
all ideas of <i>symmetry</i> had to yield to necessity: and whencesoever
a company could be most readily obtained, from that
station it was taken, irrespective of the battalion to which it
belonged. The test of a system frequently does not occur
until the system must vanish before it; and this was the
case in the wars between 1807 and 1815, which proved most
satisfactorily that the official dreams of the Ordnance in
1802 and 1803 were not worth the paper on which they were
written. Out of the web which was so honestly spun, the
company, in time of war, made its inevitable escape, and
asserted yet again its right to be called the Artillery
unit.</p>

<p>On the signing of the Treaty of Peace, at Amiens, on the
27th March, 1802, immediate reductions were ordered in the
military forces of England. In the Royal Artillery they
took the form of reductions in the strength of the companies;
and the following was the scheme, approved by the
Master General, on the recommendation of Colonel Macleod.
The short-lived amity between the French and English
Governments did not admit of the reductions being altogether
carried out; but it is interesting to see how they were proposed
to be conducted.

336. There were also 18 quartermaster-commissaries awaiting

<p>Two allusions to methods of discharging men at this time,
which are found in the official correspondence, speak for
themselves. The first is an order to discharge a man for
his bad conduct, and to <i>hand him over to the press-gang</i>: and

a man might be discharged, to enable him to support his

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> Treaty of Amiens was not destined to be carried out
in its entirety by the nations concerned. Napoleon’s
hostility to the English could not be concealed; and the
evacuation of Malta, Alexandria, and the Cape of Good Hope,
which had been commenced by the latter, in accordance with
the terms of the Treaty, was never fully completed. On the
13th March, 1803, Lord Whitworth, the English Ambassador,
was publicly insulted by Napoleon at the Tuileries; and on
the 6th May he quitted Paris. The recommencement of
hostilities with France was aggravated by another insurrection
in Ireland, which was happily quelled with little difficulty.
But the general state of affairs was so serious that an
augmentation of the military forces in England became
urgently necessary, as well as renewed activity on the part
of the fleet. The Government received warm and cordial
support from the people, both as a body and individually.
Lord Chatham, then Master-General of the Ordnance, received
<span class="sidenote">Mr. J.
Bagot,
London, to
Lord Chatham,
dated
11 July,
1803.</span>
on the 18th July a letter from a Mr. John Bagot, to
the following effect:&mdash;“Being anxious in the present awful
crisis to come forward in any line that my services can be
of use to my King and country, I beg leave to offer, for the
consideration of your Lordship, to raise a Battalion of
Artillery, of 300 men, for the war or such further period
as may be necessary, and on such terms as your Lordship
or His Majesty’s Government may direct....”</p>

<p>The state of recruiting in England was, however, so favourable,
that the Master-General was not compelled to have
recourse to private enterprise to obtain the necessary augmentations
to the Regiment. The number of non-commissioned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
officers and men in the Horse Brigade and Marching
<span class="sidenote">Mem. to
Master-Gen<sup>l</sup>.
from
Colonel
Macleod,

1803.</span>
Battalions of the Royal Artillery on the 1st January,
1803, was 6777; on the 1st June, notwithstanding the loss
of 306 men by death or discharge, the total had increased
to 7119; and in two months more, it stood at 7439, besides
131 recruits in the country districts, not yet posted. The
Corps of Gunner-drivers had increased in the same period
by 1109 men. It was therefore resolved to increase the
Regiment by another battalion, the 8th, and the first intimation
of this resolution is found in a private letter from
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Macleod to
Lieut.-Colonel
Willington,
dated
7 Sept.
1803.</span>
the Deputy Adjutant-General. “It is at last, I believe,
determined,” he wrote, “to increase the Artillery, even
under all the disadvantages of a deficiency in officers. The
cadets are doubled; and the winter may do a good deal
for us: in the mean time we take twenty of the most
forward. Our companies will only have two 1st Lieutenants:
there will be hardly a 2nd Lieutenant upon the
establishment.”</p>

<p>On the 13th September seven companies were formed, and
on the 6th December, three additional companies were added
to the battalion. The establishment of each company was

<p>Many of the men for the 8th Battalion were obtained
by calling for volunteers from the Army of Reserve; and
although every obstacle was thrown in the way of this
method of obtaining recruits, by the officers commanding
the Reserve Battalions, which were this year called out for
service, very many excellent men were thus obtained.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the Battalion record-book of the
8th Battalion has been lost since 1859, the year when
Battalion Head-quarters were abolished, because, although
these books were, as a rule, very meagre in the information
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
they afforded, they nevertheless supplied facts which it
would have been difficult to obtain elsewhere without great
<span class="sidenote">Lieut. J.
Ritchie,

Brigade,

labour. That labour, in the case of the 8th Battalion, has
been readily undertaken by an officer at Head-quarters, and
to his industry the reader is indebted for the following
tables.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the history of the companies of the 8th
and 9th Battalions, after 1850, must be postponed until
the separate work on the Crimean services of the Artillery
shall be written. But these tables give the earlier history,
and the various stations&mdash;down to about 1850&mdash;on which the
companies served, as well as the succession of Captains: and
the war services of most of the companies will be found in
the subsequent accounts of the various campaigns.</p>

<p>Between the formation of the 8th and 9th Battalions,
an augmentation of five troops of Horse Artillery took place,
as has been mentioned elsewhere. Very little interest attaches
to this period, except that in 1806 the commencement
of a garrison of Royal Artillery in Italy and Sicily took place,
which remained in these countries for some years. In 1806,
six companies of the Royal Artillery were stationed there;
in 1807 there were five; in 1808, four; in 1809, five; in
1810, five; and in 1814, the last year of the occupation,
there were four. The war in Italy, which was distinguished
in 1806 by the English victory of Maida, is thus described
by the officer who commanded the Royal Artillery on the
<span class="sidenote">Major
Lemoine,

Brig.-Gen<sup>l</sup>.
Macleod.</span>
expedition. “On the 28th June (1806) I received orders
from the Commander-in-Chief to have in readiness for a
particular service a detachment of Artillery with some
light guns. In consequence I made a collection, and on
the 30th embarked with the greater part of the army,
the Commander-in-Chief (Sir John Stuart) taking the
field. On the 2nd July we anchored on the coast of Calabria,
near St. Eufemia, and landed immediately. After
taking a position, and reconnoitring the country, we moved
forward at daylight on the 4th to the Plains of Maida,
near where the enemy, under the command of General
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
Regnier, had assembled. On our approach, he descended
to the plains, and having formed his line, which we had
already done, the two armies met near the centre of the
plain, and came to immediate action, which lasted nearly
an hour and a quarter, when the French were charged
by our Light Infantry, and their left completely turned;
the right also gave way shortly after. We pursued them
the whole extent of the plain, nearly six miles, and gained
a complete victory. The prisoners acknowledge to have
had in action 8000 men: the British army had 4600. Our
loss very trifling&mdash;only one officer killed, 41 men, and 253
wounded. The loss of the enemy cannot be correctly ascertained,
though we have taken and killed upwards of 2000.
Many of their wounded got off to the mountains, and General
Regnier among them, severely wounded. General Piegri
was killed; General Coupère wounded, and prisoner; the rest
of the army has retired in a confused state some distance,
and is much harassed by the natives. Sir John Stuart,
finding the army retiring so fast, thought it most desirable
to return to the coast, and marched to this place (Monteloine)
on the 8th, where we found 200 French, and great
quantities of stores, which we are now embarking. There
are also two or three other posts along the coast which
they left in the same manner, and which are now in our
possession. I understand that as soon as everything is
embarked, the army will return to Messina. I have the
honour to enclose you the General Orders of the 4th instant,
and have to add that the whole of the Artillery in
this little expedition were in the front of the action, and
behaved in the most cool and gallant manner. Captain
Pym, on the right of the Grenadiers, with two 6-pounders
and a howitzer, repulsed two squadrons of cavalry in attempting
to break our line. Lieutenant Bayley, with two
4-pounders, in front of the Light Infantry, made good use
of his case-shot, till that corps charged, when they ran
over his guns; indeed every officer and soldier gave me
his utmost assistance, and I should be wanting in gratitude
to them did I not acknowledge it; though to you, sir, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
should be doubly wanting, did I not take the earliest
opportunity of thanking you for having entrusted to my
command a detachment of Artillery that have so gallantly
distinguished themselves, before an enemy nearly double
their numbers.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />

<span class="medium smcap">The Ninth Battalion.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">This</span> Battalion of the Royal Artillery was formed in an
eventful year. Whether we regard it from a political
or a purely military point of view, the year 1806 had an
important influence on those which followed it.</p>

<p>The previous year, the year of Austerlitz, had witnessed
the collapse of Pitt’s coalition against Napoleon, and the
consequent isolation of England. But it was also the year
of Trafalgar; and left England still mistress of the seas.</p>

<p>With 1806 came the Battle of Jena, Napoleon’s triumphal
entry into Berlin, and the issue of his famous declaration
against English commerce, which, if obeyed to the letter,
would have put England virtually in a state of blockade. It
was a critical year for a country whose commerce was her
very life-blood; and in this very year, those who had so
long steered the ship of the State, William Pitt and Charles
James Fox, were removed by death. But the country took
up the gauntlet thrown down by Napoleon, and from this
year conducted with sternness and determination a war
which, from being one of <i>resistance</i>, became one for <i>existence</i>
as well.</p>

<p>It was a year, too, which should be remembered fondly in
the annals of the British Army&mdash;the year of the Battle of
Maida, described in the last chapter, where the gallantry of
the British troops against Napoleon’s tried legions obtained
a victory, which had a moral influence both in England and
on the Continent, which is perhaps rarely realised now.</p>

<p>Grasping the importance of the situation, and greatly
assisted by the ease of obtaining recruits, the Board of
Ordnance resolved on an augmentation of the Royal Artillery
to the extent of yet another battalion. The strength of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
Regiment, and its periodical increase and decrease, are
ascertainable from a return which used to be furnished
annually to the Board, called the “Wear and Tear of the
Regiment for the year ending,” &amp;c. From this return it
would appear that during the year 1805, the number of
gunner-recruits who joined the Horse Artillery and Marching
Battalions was no less than 2574. But the <i>wear and
tear</i> by death, transfer, desertion, &amp;c., during the same
period was 1017, so that the net increase was 1557; the
Regiment rising from 10,203, at which it stood on 1st January,
1805, to 11,760, its strength on the 31st December
in the same year. During the same period the Corps of
Royal Artillery Drivers, and Drivers attached to the Horse
Brigade, had received 489 recruits, and, allowing for the
wear and tear during the year, had increased from 4897 to
4986 of all ranks, excluding officers.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible that this large increase to the
establishment had been allowed by the Board without a
motive; and it may indeed be assumed with tolerable
certainty that the formation of the 9th Battalion had
been to some extent contemplated during Napoleon’s successes
in 1805. This impression is confirmed by reference
to the returns for the year 1806, which show that the
increase to the Regiment during that year was only half
what had taken place during the year preceding.</p>

<p>The increase which had been permitted during the year
1805 proved to be greater than was necessary for the wants
of the new Battalion; and the establishment of the Regiment
was found on the 1st May, 1806, to have been exceeded by
over 400 men. This excess, however, was soon swallowed
up by the year’s wear and tear, which in 1806 amounted to
874 men.</p>

<p>The promotions consequent on the formation of the new
Battalion were gazetted on 22nd May, 1806, and Major-General
Thomas Blomefield was appointed Colonel-Commandant.
The record-book of the Battalion, like that of the
8th, has been lost since the introduction of the Brigade
system. It was permitted to accompany the head-quarters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
of the 9th Brigade, and during their frequent changes of
station it has been mislaid&mdash;offering another argument, if
one were needed, in favour of the centralization of all
military records. As in the case of the 8th Battalion, so in
<span class="sidenote">Lieut. J.

the present instance the Regiment is indebted to an officer
at Head-quarters for the following facts connected with the
companies prior to 1850. Their present designations, and
the stations in which they served, have been given, and the
succession of Captains down to a certain date. The war
services of some companies will be found mentioned in the
succeeding narrative, and the tables will be completed,
should the compilation of the separate work on the Crimea
be at some future time accomplished.</p>

<span class="medium smcap">The Siege of Copenhagen.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> decree of the French Emperor, dated 20th November,
1806, forbidding all commerce and correspondence
between the countries under his influence, and Great
Britain, received an alarming force from his subsequent
rapid successes, culminating in the Treaty of Tilsit.</p>

<p>After that date it was evident that, in addition to injuring
the commercial marine of England, Napoleon was resolved
to make a great effort to overthrow her yet unquestionable
naval supremacy. This he hoped to effect by a union of his
own fleet with those of his allies and subjects; and one of
the most powerful which he hoped to secure for his purpose
was the Danish fleet.</p>

<p>The English Government resolved on a bold step, in
order to defeat Napoleon’s aim. They decided to request
the Danish Government to hand over their fleet to England
for safe keeping, and they supported their petition by the
presence of a large naval and military force. This determination
was arrived at on the 19th July, 1807; and before
the 29th the whole force was ready to sail. The fleet
<span class="sidenote">Cust.</span>
consisted of 17 ships of the line, between 30 and 40 frigates,
and other smaller ships of war, counting 90 pendants;
together with 300 transports, having on board 20,000
troops, a number subsequently increased to 27,000. The
<span class="sidenote">Official MS.

R. A. Record
Office.</span>
Artillery force was as follows: Royal Artillery, 989; Royal
Artillery drivers, 525; German Legion Artillery&mdash;horse,
182, and foot, 512.</p>

<p>The command of this large Artillery force was given to
Major-General Thomas Blomefield on the 28th July, 1807,
in the following terms.

<p>General Thomas Blomefield, who joined the Regiment on
1st January, 1759, had seen active service at the Havannah,
in the West Indies, and during the American War. He had
been severely wounded during the last-mentioned campaign.
In 1780 he was made Inspector of Ordnance at Woolwich;
and for many years held this appointment in a manner most
advantageous to the country. He was a good mathematician,
an excellent chemist, and most laborious in experiments
in gunnery. His private character is thus described
<span class="sidenote">Family
MSS.</span>
by one who knew him intimately:&mdash;“There was no display
of his merits shown in his manner; all his duties and
improvements were silently and unassumingly carried on,
with a natural reserve and undeviating correctness, so
that it was only the close observer who could duly
appreciate his value. His being generally and greatly
esteemed arose as much from his being the perfect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
gentleman as from the ingenuous turn of his mind, for
there was no glare or obtrusive view, but rather a strong
desire to improve the service with as little parade as
possible.” The marked improvement in English ordnance
while he was Inspector, was tested at the very siege over
which he was to preside, and is thus alluded to by the same
writer. “The late sieges of Copenhagen and in the Peninsula,
where the mode of battering assumed a rapidity of
firing unknown on former occasions, strongly marked the
confidence his gallant brother officers had in the weapons
placed in their hands, and surprised the enemy, who were
known to declare that they could not have put their iron
ordnance of this description to such a severe test. The
complete success of these objects of his most serious and
careful pursuit will be duly appreciated by those capable
of judging of their merits. To such as are not, it may
be allowed to suggest that many gallant lives have been
saved to their country and families by the constant and
most anxious endeavours he at all times pursued to put
safe and perfect machines into the hands of the brave
defenders of His Majesty’s dominions.”</p>

<p>The following is a nominal list of the officers of the
Royal Artillery who accompanied General Blomefield to
Copenhagen<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonels Harding, Cookson, and Robe; Captains
May, Cockburn, Franklin, Newhouse, Fyers, P. Drummond,
Brome, and Meadows; 2nd Captains Bolton, J. P.
Adye, Paterson, Unett, Whinyates, Sandham, Holcroft, and
Kettlewell; 1st Lieutenants Darby, Stewart, Collyer,
Orlebar, Molesworth, Cubitt, Campbell, Sinclair, Coxwell,
Dyneley, Macbean, Rayner, Cavines, Hunt, Somerville, and
Lord; 2nd Lieutenants Wright, Swabey, Lyon, Wilson,
Thomson, Fuller, Forster, and Maling.</p>

<p>Captain Fyers acted as Aide-de-Camp to General Blomefield,
and Captains Drummond and Whinyates were on his
Brigade Staff.</p>

<p>No less than 185 pieces of ordnance accompanied the
Expedition. Of these, 84 were field guns, including 6, 9,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
and 12-pounders, and 5½ and 8-inch howitzers. The last-named,
although included among the field-guns, were evidently
for use in the trenches. The guns taken for siege
purposes were as follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The number of rounds of ammunition sent was 61,472; but
only 11,378 were expended when the city surrendered. There
was considerable difficulty in getting transports at so short a
notice for the Artillery and their horses. When writing on
the 28th July, the Deputy-Adjutant-General had heard of
no ships at all for the purpose; but at 2.30 <small>A.M.</small> on the 29th,
an express reached him from Gravesend, informing him of
their arrival, and that the embarkation was required to take
place immediately. Collecting all the boats he could find,
he embarked the men at Woolwich, and sent them down to
Gravesend with the tide. In writing subsequently to the
Master-General, he said: “It is but fair to the officers and
men to say that, without previous notice, they were all
assembled at 9, and at the waterside by 10, in complete
order, and with all their baggage.”</p>

<p>The main part of the Expedition sailed from Yarmouth,
and General Blomefield embarked there, on board the
‘Valiant,’ on the 2nd August. Lord Cathcart, who was to
command the whole of the land forces, did not join until
<span class="sidenote">Cust.</span>
their arrival in the road of Elsineur.</p>

<p>The British Infantry numbered 15,351, and was commanded
by General Burrard. The 1st Division was commanded
by Sir George Ludlow, assisted by Major-General
Finch and Brigadier Warde; the 2nd Division by Sir David
Baird, assisted by Major-Generals Grosvenor and Spencer
and Brigadier Macfarlane. The Reserve was under the
command of Major-General Sir Arthur Wellesley, and included
<span class="sidenote">Blomefield
MSS.</span>
ten companies of the 95th, or Rifle Corps, besides
three other battalions. The King’s German Legion, under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
the command of the Earl of Rosslyn, numbered 9951 of all
ranks.</p>

<p>At 5 <small>A.M.</small> on the morning of the 16th August, 1807, the
Reserve of the army, under Sir A. Wellesley, landed at
Webeck, about twelve miles from Copenhagen. Captain
Newhouse’s and Captain Brome’s Light Brigades of Artillery,
under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Cookson, were attached
to the Reserve. No opposition was made to the landing.
The remainder of the army, with the exception of General
Spencer’s Brigade, landed at the same place, and in the
<span class="sidenote">Blomefield
MSS.</span>
afternoon the whole moved forward in three columns towards
Charlotte-lund, about five miles from Copenhagen, off which
place the transports, convoyed by the fleet, anchored the
same evening. On the following morning, General Spencer’s
Brigade landed at Charlotte-lund, and marched to the left of
Sir David Baird’s head-quarters, where, on the 20th, it was
joined by Captain May’s Brigade of 6-pounders. Captain
Unett’s Brigade of 6-pounders was attached to Sir David
Baird’s Division, and Captain Paterson’s, of 9-pounders, was
placed on the left of the line. The city of Copenhagen was
now completely invested by the army, and the landing of
guns and stores for the siege commenced. The difficulties
which seem to have been inseparable from our campaigns in
those days, as far as supply of stores, &amp;c., was concerned,
<span class="sidenote">Lieut.-Col.
Harding to
Colonel
Macleod.</span>
were present on this occasion. “We should have been
greatly distressed in the horse department if Colonel
Robe had not taken it. No Captain-Commissary or Veterinary
Surgeon has arrived. We are in great distress
for horses; I am obliged to send the two brigades preparing,
without cars. We shall want ammunition for the
9 and 6-pounders; there are only 300 rounds per gun, and
a considerable quantity is already gone. Pray get some
more sent, and a greater supply of Shrapnel’s shells: there
is a great call for them, and we have with us only 27 per
gun.... Pray send us a few extra subalterns; we work
day and night at unloading. Lieut.-Colonel Cookson is
advanced with the four first brigades; Lieut.-Colonel
Robe encamps the horses and carriages, which is full
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
employ; and I attend unloading and supplying demands.
General Blomefield is at head-quarters. <i>We are distressed
by so many different things being put in the store ships; the
things at bottom are required first, in many instances, and
we half unload the ship to get at them.</i>”</p>

<p>The operations in which the expenditure of ammunition
took place&mdash;alluded to by Colonel Harding&mdash;were prior to
the investment of Copenhagen, and were conducted by Sir
A. Wellesley with complete success. During their progress,
a very gallant Artillery officer, Lieutenant Lyons, was killed
by a 3-pounder shot, from a gun which had been placed by
the enemy on the Copenhagen road. On account of the
facilities offered by the coast, and a continuance of fine
weather, the Danish gun-boats took part in these operations.
The conduct of the Royal Artillery was thus mentioned by
<span class="sidenote">Sir A. Wellesley
to
Lord Cathcart,
Kioge,
29 Aug.
1807.</span>
Sir Arthur Wellesley:&mdash;“I cannot close this letter without
expressing to your Lordship my sense of the good conduct
of the troops. All conducted themselves with the utmost
steadiness; but I cannot avoid to mention particularly the
British Artillery under the command of Captain Newhouse.”</p>

<p>From the 21st August to the 1st September, the Artillerymen
were employed in making and arming the batteries
necessary for the bombardment. The distribution of these
batteries when the bombardment commenced, on the 2nd September,
was as follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The erection of the batteries was not carried on without
molestation from the enemy; but on the 1st September they
were so near completion, that the city was summoned to
capitulate, prior to the commencement of the bombardment.
The summons having been refused, the batteries opened at
7.30 <small>P.M.</small> on the 2nd, and the fire continued, with but little
reply, for twelve hours. The city was set on fire by the
first flight of shells (not <i>rockets</i>, as stated by Sir E. Cust,
which would appear to have been used as a siege weapon for
the first time, subsequently, at Flushing), and continued
burning all night. During the afternoon of this day, another
battery of eight 24-pounders had been armed by the Royal
Artillery.</p>

<p>The expenditure of ammunition during the first night
having been considered excessive, orders were given that no
more than one shell per hour should be fired from each
battery during the day, but that at 7 <small>P.M.</small> on the 3rd September,
firing should commence at the rate of one shell in
every three minutes, from each battery, for the space of
sixteen hours. The same orders were obeyed on the night
of the 4th, the city suffering terribly from fires in all parts,
and no fewer than 1500 of the inhabitants having been
killed. Towards 4 <small>A.M.</small> on the 5th, the principal steeple in
the city fell, and at 8 <small>P.M.</small> on that day, a flag of truce was
sent out, and the bombardment was suspended. On the 6th,
two additional batteries were armed, and sailors were landed
from the fleet to man them; but a second flag of truce
having been sent from the city, Sir A. Wellesley, Sir H.
Popham, and Colonel Murray went in the evening into the
town, having received directions to order a continuation of
the bombardment on their return, should their proposals
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
not be accepted. They did not return until next morning,
bringing, however, the intelligence that the terms of the
capitulation had been agreed to. <i>These included the unconditional
surrender of the Danish fleet.</i> During the evening
of the 7th the citadel was taken possession of by the Grenadiers,
accompanied by a detachment of the German Rifle
Corps, a troop of Dragoons, and a brigade of Artillery. On
the same evening the following General Order was published<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Headquarters,
Hellerup,
7 Sept.
1807.</div>

<p>“The Commander of the Forces cannot delay expressing
his warmest thanks to all the General Officers and Staff for
the great and able assistance he has received from all of
them, in their several ranks and stations. And he feels
himself, in like manner, obliged to all the officers commanding
brigades or regiments, and the officers and
soldiers under their command.</p>

<p>“He must, however, be allowed, in a particular manner,
to express his thanks to Major-General Blomefield and
Colonel D’Arcy, and the officers and corps of the Royal
Artillery and Engineers, whose laborious science and
success, collectively and individually, have been most
remarkable, and reflect great honour on that branch of
His Majesty’s service.”</p>

<p>The naval stores captured were very valuable, and their
weight exceeded 20,000 tons. No fewer than 3500 pieces
of ordnance were also taken. By the 20th October the
whole army had re-embarked, and reached England without
loss. One cannot but regret that the object of the Expedition
could not have been attained in a different manner;
and that the means employed were not as justifiable as they
were successful.</p>

<p>There are various points of interest connected with the
services of the Artillery during the siege, which seem
worthy of mention. The following extracts from General
Blomefield’s letters to Lord Chatham speak for themselves:
<span class="sidenote">Dated
9 Sept.
1807.</span>
... It is with great satisfaction that I have to congratulate
your Lordship on the fortunate issue of our
Expedition, and on the distinguished share which fell to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
the lot of our corps in accomplishing so desirable an event;
and I should do them great injustice were I not to mention
their exertions in the strongest manner, as well in the
laborious task of landing and transporting the Artillery
and stores to the batteries, from four to eight miles
distance, as in the active and intelligent use of them
when employed.... I believe there are very few instances
of so powerful an effect being produced in so short
a time, and with so little loss of lives. Six thousand
shells and carcases were thrown into the town (which is
very spacious), from mortars, howitzers, and guns, during
the short period of two nights and one day.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dated
12 Sept.
1807.</div>

<p>Again: “I cannot sufficiently commend the conduct of the
officers and men under my command. Your Lordship will
observe by the enclosed sketch of the batteries, how formidable
the attack must have been under those three
excellent officers, Lieut.-Colonels Harding, Robe, and
Cookson; and nothing could resist so heavy a fire.”</p>

<p>The satisfaction of the Master-General may be gathered
from his reply<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Chatham
to
General
Blomefield,
Sept. 19,
1807.</div>

<p>“I received your letter of the 7th inst., and rejoiced most
truly in the prosperous issue of the Expedition to Zealand.
The satisfaction I derived from this event was, I assure you,
much increased from the very highly honourable and distinguished
part borne in this enterprise by the Corps of
Royal Artillery under your command, and whose exertions
are the theme of general admiration. I am sincerely happy
in communicating to you that His Majesty has announced
his gracious intentions of conferring upon you the dignity
of a Baronet, as a testimony of the sense entertained of
your eminent services on this occasion.... What
a sad contrast is the miserable business of Buenos Ayres!”</p>

<p>On the 28th September, Lord Cathcart received a despatch
from Lord Castlereagh, expressing His Majesty’s high
approbation of the army’s performance; and this was communicated
to the troops on the same evening. Lord Cathcart

and departments, to which, under the blessing of Providence,

Copenhagen surrendered&mdash;patience, discipline, and exertion.</p>

<p>A long-standing right was claimed for his corps by General
<span class="sidenote">Letter
dated
12 Sept.

Blomefield, from Lord Cathcart, after the siege. “It being
an invariable custom in our service, whenever a place capitulates
after a siege, to allow the officer commanding the
Royal Artillery a claim of the bells in the town, and its
dependencies, or a compensation in lieu of them,&mdash;which
has twice occurred upon services in which I have been employed,
viz. the sieges of the Havannah, and Fort Royal
in Martinique,&mdash;I conceive it to be my duty which I owe to
my brother officers, as well as myself, to express my hope
that in the present instance it will not be dispensed with.”</p>

<p>On the 3rd November, 1807, General Blomefield was created
a Baronet; and the story of the Expedition concludes with
the thanks of the Houses of Parliament being voted to the
army and the fleet which had been engaged. This was communicated
by Sir Thomas Blomefield&mdash;now at Woolwich&mdash;to
the officers and men who had served under him, both
belonging to his own corps and to the Artillery of the
King’s German Legion. In the language used by him in
addressing the former, may be detected the strength in his
bosom of that Regimental feeling which it is the main object
of this work to strengthen. “It therefore only remains
with the General,” he wrote, “to add his sincere thanks
for their highly meritorious conduct, by which they have
acquitted themselves no less to their own credit than to
that of the corps in which they have the honour to serve.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;It may have been merely accidental, but it is worthy of note
that while the Master-General corresponded <i>directly</i> with General Blomefield
during this service, the Deputy Adjutant-General corresponded with

<div class="sidenote">Letter to
D. A. Gen.
12 Jan.
1806.</div>

<p>On the 12th January, 1806, Major Spicer, who commanded
the Artillery with Sir David Baird’s Expedition to the Cape
of Good Hope, reported that, two days previously, Cape Town
had fallen into their hands. During the operations which
resulted in this important capture, the officers and men
under his command behaved in a “persevering, cool, and
steady manner.” The heavy surf prevented him from
landing more than six 6-pounders and two 5½-inch howitzers,
the whole of which were in action and did good service,
although outnumbered, three to one, by the artillery of the
enemy. Captains Turner and Ogilvie received special
mention for their conduct on the occasion.</p>

<p>In the beginning of April, Major Spicer went on a tour
of inspection round the outposts, leaving Captain Ogilvie&mdash;his
Brigade-Major&mdash;sick at Cape Town. He had barely started,
when the Admiral, Sir Home Popham, resolved&mdash;on his own
responsibility, and entirely without the knowledge of the English
Government&mdash;to proceed with a naval and military force
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
to South America, for the purpose of attacking the Spanish settlements,
and securing the trade of the country for England.
General Beresford was put in command of the military part
of the Expedition; and the detachment of the Royal Artillery,
which was at first ordered to accompany it, consisted of
Lieutenant A. Macdonald, 1 bombardier, 1 <i>lance</i>-bombardier,
18 gunners, 1 conductor, 1 wheeler, 1 collar-maker, 1 corporal
and 9 men of the Gunner-driver Corps, and 18 horses.
Captain Ogilvie having offered to resign his staff appointment
if allowed to accompany the force, his offer was
accepted; and in a letter which he wrote from St. Helena,
<i>en route</i>, he was able to announce that the detachment under
his command had been augmented by an officer and 100
gunners of the St. Helena Artillery. The fleet consisted of
5 men-of-war, and the military force, in addition to the
Artillery, was composed of a detachment of the 20th Light
Dragoons, a few Engineers, and the 71st Regiment. The
Expedition reached a point about twelve miles distant from
Buenos Ayres, and on the 25th June, 1806, a landing was
effected. Advancing boldly, and driving the Spanish troops
before them, the English reached the city, and on the 28th
June summoned the Governor to surrender&mdash;a summons to
which he immediately yielded. So small, however, was the
force under General Beresford’s command, that he could not
hold the city; and in a very short time the English troops had
actually to surrender as prisoners of war. Sir Home Popham
continued to blockade the river for some time; but was
soon ordered home to be tried by court-martial for his
unauthorized proceedings. Thus ended the first act of this
unfortunate drama.</p>

<p>The English Government, although disapproving of the
original Expedition, was compelled to take some steps to
avenge the disaster to Beresford’s force. The fleet, now
under the command of Admiral Sterling, had already been
<span class="sidenote">Captain
Watson to
D. A. Gen.

considerably increased; and reinforcements from the Cape of
Good Hope had arrived, including a few Artillerymen under
Captain A. Watson, four troops of the 20th,&mdash;and two of the
21st, Light Dragoons, the 38th, 47th, and a detachment of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
the 54th Regiment. A further force of 3000 men under the
command of Sir S. Auchmuty was ordered to the River La
Plata, and arrived on the 5th January, 1807; the Artillery
being under the command of Captain Dickson. Captain
Watson shortly after this date returned to the Cape of Good
Hope, and the command of the Royal Artillery devolved for
the time on Captain Dickson. Prior, however, to this taking
place, Sir S. Auchmuty decided on an attempt on Monte
Video, and took the place by assault on the 3rd February,
1807. The conduct of the Artillery on this occasion may be
ascertained from the following extract from the General
Order, which was published immediately after the capture of
<span class="sidenote">‘London
Gazette,’
13 April,
1807.</span>
the town:&mdash;“The established reputation of the Royal Artillery
has been firmly supported by the company under my
orders; and I consider myself much indebted to Captains
Watson, Dickson, Carmichael, and Wilgress, for their
zealous and able exertions.” On this occasion Captain
Wilgress, who acted as Adjutant to the Artillery, was
wounded.</p>

<p>On the 2nd June, an additional force of 4200 men, under
General Craufurd, arrived at Monte Video from England;
and the command of the whole army devolved upon a most
incapable officer, General Whitelocke. With this last reinforcement
came a troop of Horse Artillery, now C Battery,
B Brigade, under Captain A. Frazer, who, being senior to
Captain Dickson, now assumed command of the Artillery, and
retained it until the active operations were over, when he
was relieved by Lieut.-Colonel Schalch, who reached Monte
Video on the 26th July, 1807.</p>

<p>General Beresford’s force still remained prisoners of war&mdash;some
remaining at Buenos Ayres, the others divided in
small detachments among the various villages in the neighbourhood.
General Linières, the French commander of the
Spanish forces, was most kind and courteous to the prisoners,
and did all he could to promote their comfort. But the
feeling of the people, more especially of the Roman Catholic
clergy, was very bitter against the English, and led to a
painful occurrence. On the 14th January, Captain Ogilvie,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
while riding with Colonel Pack of the 71st Regiment&mdash;who
was also a prisoner of war&mdash;was assassinated; and his companion
with difficulty escaped. Captain Ogilvie had been
severely wounded at the first attack on Buenos Ayres, and
his loss was deeply regretted. The command of the captive
Artillery now devolved upon Lieutenant Alexander Macdonald,
who had received two wounds in the attack on
Buenos Ayres, and who had been recommended by Captain
Ogilvie as a most deserving and zealous young officer.</p>

<p>General Whitelocke decided on a second assault on Buenos
Ayres; having first, and unsuccessfully, attempted to persuade
General Linières to release his prisoners. The failure
of his attempt on the city will, perhaps, be more readily
understood, if a few words of description of Buenos Ayres, as
it was in 1807, precede the narrative.</p>

<p>The city extended for nearly three miles along the banks
of the Rio de la Plata, and its breadth at the widest point
was about a mile and a half. The population, including the
suburban villas or <i>quintas</i>, was about 70,000. Like most
modern cities in the United States and Canada, it had been
<span class="sidenote">Captain
Frazer’s
and Capt.
Dickson’s
Letters to
D. A. Gen.</span>
built on a fixed plan, not left to the distorted tastes of individual
proprietors&mdash;as is not unfrequently the case in
England. Its streets and squares were large, broad, and
convenient; and although the individual houses did not
always harmonise, and were rarely impressive, they did little
injury to the general effect. Most of them were two-storeyed,
and built in Moorish fashion, in the form of a square, with
one large entry, the different apartments on the ground floor
opening into the square, and the roof flat, and occasionally
terraced. The Fort, or Citadel, was a miserable work, with a
parapet of little more than two feet in height. In many
places it was incapable of resisting artillery fire, and, at the
best, was of little use save in overawing a mob, or as a
receptacle for the city treasure and the public records. The
most important public buildings were the Cathedral, and the
churches of St. Francisco, St. Domingo, St. Michael, and the
Jesuits&mdash;all imposing enough externally, but with gaudy
interiors, which offended the sober taste of English travellers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
There was also a large civic hall, known as the Cabildos; and
the Plaza de Toros, where the passion of the inhabitants for
bull-fighting was gratified, was a very striking place. The
Custom-house, Arsenal, and theatres were small and unimposing.</p>

<p>For many reasons Buenos Ayres was admirably adapted
for defence against an enemy whose attack should develop
itself in the form of street fighting. The barracks were
scattered over the city in low, retired squares, and the houses
were like so many small fortifications. Their shape rendered
each perfectly distinct, and not easily assailable save from a
neighbouring roof. This one weak point led to the passing
of a law, which might have led at times to embarrassing
results, under which the proprietor of one house was permitted
to <i>fire at any stranger whom he might detect on the roof
of an adjoining one</i>. The gates and doors of the houses
were very strong, made of wood several inches thick, and
heavily bolted and barred; the windows had strong iron
railings outside, and heavy wooden shutters with iron fastenings
within; and the flat roofs were very useful, both for
offence and defence. Altogether, it was as awkward a city
to take in the way unhappily chosen by General Whitelocke,
as can be imagined.</p>

<p>In most of the squares enclosed by the larger houses there
were wells; but the water was brackish, and the inhabitants
preferred the water from the river, which was sold in the
streets, and which, although somewhat muddy, became clear
when allowed to stand, and, with the addition of a little
alum, was believed to have peculiar virtues for clearing and
strengthening the voice. The river, between Buenos Ayres
and Colonia, was about thirty miles in breadth; and it should
be mentioned that the latter place had already surrendered to
a force of 800 English troops, under Colonel Pack of the 71st,
who had made his escape from Buenos Ayres shortly after the
assassination of Captain Ogilvie. The Artillery with this force
was commanded by Captain Wilgress, who had recovered from
the wound he received at Monte Video, only to receive a second
and more severe injury at Colonia. His detachment manned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
two light 6-pounders and two light 3-pounders; and he had
in addition eight Spanish 16-pounders, with which it was
intended to arm the defensive works proposed to be erected
at Colonia. Had these last-mentioned guns, and the siege
ordnance left at the village of Reduccion and at Monte Video,
been brought against Buenos Ayres, with a view to its bombardment,
there is no doubt that the city, whose streets
proved a tomb to the attacking forces, would have been their
prize.</p>

<p>The country round Buenos Ayres was well wooded, and
the land in the immediate vicinity rich and singularly productive.
Thanks to the inquiring minds of General Beresford’s
force, it was ascertained that beef, mutton, fowls, and
river fish, were cheap and abundant, bread excellent, and the
markets filled daily soon after sunrise with wild-fowl, quails,
and partridges in abundance. The last-named birds must
have resembled the Canadian tree partridge, as they were
caught with ease, even in the immediate suburbs, by means
of a noose at the end of a stick. There was abundance of
larger game in the country, both four-footed and winged, and
<span class="sidenote">Major
Nicolls’
Diary.</span>
vulltures and birds of that class, luckily, very common too,
otherwise the air would be infected by the quantity of
carrion left after the men, dogs, and pigs had been
satisfied.... Bullocks are here what the cocoa-trees
are in India. They turn them to the following uses: food,
fuel, shoes, ropes, trunks, sacks, covering for houses, beds,
bridles, saddles, bird-cages, drinking-cups, &amp;c...··
Their horses are the accidental breed of the country, descended
from those originally brought by the Spaniards.
They are undersized, but show some blood, are very tractable,
and hardy. Each proprietor affixes his mark on his
droves, makes geldings of them, and they run wild till
required for use or sale. They are driven in now and
then for inspection. The King of Spain is a proprietor;
his mark is the tip of the left ear cut off. They are of
very trifling value in the drove&mdash;not more than half a
dollar each. It is not uncommon for a traveller whose
horse is jaded to catch another and leave his own. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
Peons, or country people, who have more Indian than
Spanish blood in them, are very expert horsemen. They
tame a wild horse in a few hours, but by severe treatment.
Their bridles are those used by the Mamelukes, and they
use stick and spur without reluctance.”</p>

<p>The chief exports from Buenos Ayres were hides, tallow,
skins of valuable animals, bark, coffee, and spices; the imports
were cloths, wearing apparel, glass, earthenware,
cutlery, &amp;c. So extensive was the trade of the place, and so
keen were the inhabitants for its development, that it is not
to be wondered at that, in the first flush of short-lived
conquest, the English commanders dwelt on its possible advantage
to Great Britain in terms, which the hope of justifying
an unauthorized expedition may possibly have made
somewhat fervent.</p>

<p>The moral aspect of Buenos Ayres in 1807 seems to have
been very uninviting. Immorality of the grossest description
prevailed in both sexes and in all classes; indolence and
intemperance characterized the lower orders, and the whole
community was priest-ridden to an intolerable extent. The
Bishop, in particular, tyrannized over all ranks and classes;
and when he went anywhere in state every one knelt to him,
the guards even presenting arms to him kneeling. During
the short time that General Beresford commanded, the
Bishop demanded the same ceremony from the English
troops; but it was refused, and he never forgave it. He was
a very crafty man, and to the last he affected good-will to
the English; but by his orders every pulpit was used for
fulminating threats against them, and for inventing and
exaggerating tales of English atrocity. To such an extent
was this carried, that the better class of the inhabitants did
not dare to make any advances to the English officers, or show
them open kindness, although they always welcomed them to
their houses if they came uninvited. The revenue of the
Bishop was very great, and included a fourth part of all sums
paid as fees at births, marriages, and funerals, the amount of
which varied with the will and ability of the parties concerned,
or their friends. Another fourth went to the King, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
remainder to the canons of the church in which the necessary
ceremony was performed. The priests of Buenos Ayres were
very numerous, and their private life was said to be most immoral.
As regarded the people generally, Major Nicolls wrote:
“With respect to religion, they appear to attend pretty
regularly to its exterior forms, especially the women, who
attend mass daily, in which, however, the men do not show
so much zeal. Since, however, vice of every description
follows, it does not appear likely that forms of this nature
would be very useful, either in this world or as a preparation
for that to come. On General Beresford’s taking the
city many thousands of indulgences and remissions of all
kinds were found, which have ever proved a source of revenue
and power to the Roman Catholic clergy, and are
here made the tools of Government.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> The Bishop amuses
the high and low every week with some pompous procession
or ceremony to make the great remember that there is such
a thing as religion. To the sick he holds out forty days’
plenary indulgence for going to mass and giving alms;
and the poor are governed by a promise that their sins
shall be forgiven. On our landing, the Bishop induced the
people to swear they would defend the place to the last,
for which their sins should be forgiven.”</p>

<p>Against this city General Whitelocke resolved to move the
greater part of his force, leaving small garrisons in Monte
Video and Colonia. Before describing the Expedition, an
anecdote is worthy of mention, as showing, what has so
frequently been shown already, the evil effects of the dual
government of the Artillery which existed in the days of
the Board of Ordnance. There is deposited in the Royal
<span class="sidenote">Dated
Monte
Video,
6 June,
1807.</span>
Artillery Record Office the original order to Captain Frazer,
signed by General Whitelocke, desiring him, as commanding
officer of Artillery and representing the Ordnance Department,
“to pay the sum of <i>forty pounds</i> sterling for every
field-piece that may be captured from the enemy during
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
the approaching service at Buenos Ayres, according to
the established usage of the service in such cases.”</p>

<p>In the same office is a correspondence in which Captain
Frazer is <i>forbidden</i> by the Board to make any such payment.
The question for consideration is not whether the General or
the Board was right in the interpretation of the Regulations.
The error of the system was that the officer who received an
order from the General, under whom he was immediately
serving, was made the channel for conveying to that General
an intimation that his order was wrong, and was not to be
obeyed. The marvel is that, under such a system, harmony
was <i>ever</i> possible between the commanding officer of Artillery
and his General; and, certainly, if tact could have been
imparted to a cadet at the Academy, along with his mathematics,
he would probably have found it the more useful
accomplishment of the two in his after career.</p>

<p>The arrangements made by Captain Frazer for the transport
and service of the Artillery were admirable and exhaustive.
In General Whitelocke’s report of the subsequent
operations, he used the following terms of commendation:&mdash;“I
<span class="sidenote">‘London
Gazette’
extraordinary,
13 Sept.
1807.</span>
cannot sufficiently bring to notice the uncommon exertions
of Captain Frazer, commanding the Royal Artillery,
the fertility of whose mind, zeal, and animation, in all cases
left difficulties behind.” That Captain Frazer was staunchly
supported by the officers and men under his command is
apparent from his letters. Captain Dickson, whom he had
superseded, and under whom, singularly enough, he was
destined to serve in the Peninsula, was most loyal in his
<span class="sidenote">Captain
Frazer to
D. A. Gen.
21 June,
1807.</span>
exertions, and earned the following acknowledgment:&mdash;“I
have met with so much assistance from Captain Dickson,
whom I found in command of the Artillery on my arrival,
that it is at once my duty and my inclination to report
to you the sense I entertain of his valuable assistance.
But it is unnecessary for me to mention more than the
name of a brother-officer who is at once so highly and so
deservedly valued.” And again, after the conclusion of
the campaign: “If, in my several letters to you, I have not
mentioned Captains Hawker and Dickson, you will, I trust,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
impute this to the real cause&mdash;a delicacy in venturing to
express an opinion of officers of equal standing in the
Regiment with myself, and with whom, in many cases, I
should feel myself flattered to be compared.”</p>

<p>Captain Frazer had urged the propriety of heavy artillery
accompanying the army, with a view to a bombardment of
the city, prior to an assault; and in answer to an argument
employed&mdash;that Monte Video would be left unprotected&mdash;he
drew out a detailed statement showing that no less than
145 guns, mortars, and howitzers would be left mounted in
that city, besides 270 dismounted. He further showed that
there was an abundance of ammunition for these guns; and
he detailed three officers to remain behind, of whom he was
<span class="sidenote">Captain
Frazer
to D. A. G.
R. A.</span>
afterwards able to say: “Colonel Brown, Commandant of
the Garrison of Monte Video, has expressed to me his high
sense of the exertions of Captain Durnford and Lieutenants
England and Stopford, whose exertions were unremitting
during our temporary absence.” But his appeal was to
no purpose. General Whitelocke had determined to land at
a place about thirty miles from Buenos Ayres, called
Enfinada de Barragon, and thence march over the swamps
which intervened, and which would have made the movement
of heavy artillery very difficult. With great difficulty,
Captain Frazer obtained permission to take three 24-pounders,
two 12-inch Spanish mortars, and two 5½-inch
howitzers as a reserve, in addition to his field guns; but these,
which would have been so useful in the subsequent attack,
were not allowed to proceed farther than the village of
Reduccion, where the first encounter with the enemy took
place. The following was the detail of the Royal Artillery
which actually took part in the attack on Buenos Ayres, on
the 5th July, 1807<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Captain Frazer erred rather in being too minute in his
arrangements, than the reverse; he wrote his orders with
his own hand, and knowing the nature of the country which
the men would have to traverse after disembarkation, he
issued the most detailed instructions before leaving Monte
Video, as to dress, diet, horses, &amp;c. These are too long for reproduction,
but some are quaintly amusing, and one suggests
a new use for foot-straps to a gunner dismounted. “The men
will land with one great coat and blanket each, with a
flannel waistcoat, brush, comb, razor, and shaving-brush
rolled up in the blanket; and with such proportion of
cooked provisions as may be directed. <i>Every man to have
shoe-straps tied round his shoes to keep them on in boggy
ground</i>; the men’s hair to be plaited up behind, not tied
in a queue; the great coats and blankets to be rolled up
so as to leave them as much as possible the full and free
use of their limbs.”</p>

<p>To each Brigade of guns was attached a cart containing
long troughs, which were laid over very swampy ground or
across ditches, and in which the gun-wheels were made to
travel, which otherwise would have sunk to the axletrees.
In fact everything which ingenuity could devise to lighten
the difficulties of the operation was thought of by Captain
Frazer. That he was rewarded by success is apparent by
<span class="sidenote">Captain
Frazer,
R.H.A., to
D. A. Gen.</span>
the following extract:&mdash;“During the advance the Artillery
exerted themselves to the admiration of the whole army;
the Artillerymen pulling at the drag-ropes up to their
waists in water.... In the most difficult ground they
were continually obliged to restrain their zeal, lest they
should outmarch the army, whose repeated intimations of
‘Easy the Artillery!’ were most gratifying.” Of the
services of his own troop of Horse Artillery, Captain Frazer
wrote: “The conduct of the officers and men was admirable,
yet it were better that the praise due to Quartermaster-Sergeant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
Hay and the men of the Horse Artillery should
come from any other pen than mine; but their gallantry
and intelligence have ensured the respect of the whole
army. It would be injustice not to mention in terms of
the most unequivocal commendation Quartermaster-Sergeant
Hay, in whom the valuable qualities of clear arrangements
and undaunted courage are joined to the
greatest zeal; this man is cast in no ordinary mould.”</p>

<p>On arrival at Buenos Ayres, after two engagements at
Reduccion and Passo Chico, in which the English were
successful, General Whitelocke completely invested the
city. The plan of attack on which he decided was to enter
the place in separate columns by totally different entrances
<span class="sidenote">‘Gazette,’
13 Sept.
1807.</span>
and streets; each column to march “along the street
directly in its front, till it arrived at the last square of
houses next the River La Plata, of which it was to possess
itself, forming on the flat roofs, and there wait for further
orders. No firing was to be permitted until the columns
had reached their final points and formed.” The reader,
who has already been informed of the size of Buenos Ayres,
and the style of the houses, will at once see the madness of
such a method of attack; but the extraordinary thing to be
noted is that General Whitelocke employed, as an argument
for the course he adopted, the very circumstance which
should have forbidden him to hazard his troops in the
dangerous and unsatisfactory occupation of street fighting.
“The knowledge,” he wrote, “that the enemy meant to
occupy the flat roofs of the houses gave rise to the plan of
attack.”</p>

<p>The guns accompanied the columns; but “the detachments
of the Horse Artillery were not mounted, and of the Cavalry
only two squadrons had their horses.” The attack took
place on the 5th July, and if endurance and courage among
the troops could have redeemed their General’s blunder, this
would have been done. At the end of the day no fewer
than 2500 men were killed, wounded, or prisoners. The
battle was just what might have been foreseen. In General
Whitelocke’s own words, “The nature of the fire to which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
the troops were exposed was violent in the extreme.
Grape shot at the corners of all the streets, musketry,
hand grenades, bricks, and stones from the tops of all the
houses; every householder with his negroes defended his
dwelling, each of which was in itself a fortress, and it is
not, perhaps, too much to say that the whole male population
of Buenos Ayres was employed in its defence.”
General Whitelocke’s subsequent conviction by court-martial
for incapacity might have been assured on his own
testimony.</p>

<p>The only real gain to the English army at the end of the
day was the possession of the Plaza de Toros: and its
situation was such, that, if fortified, it would have commanded
the town, and perhaps compelled the inhabitants to
insist on a surrender. Captain Frazer urged this without
success: he pointed out that with some guns captured that
day from the Spaniards he could construct a battery of
26 guns, immediately serviceable, and strengthen it by
unspiking 10 other pieces of ordnance which had been for
a time rendered unserviceable by the enemy, prior to their
capture: he assured the General that there were not less
than 600 barrels of powder, captured that day in the
Arsenal of Buenos Ayres, and an apparent abundance of
every requisite for the service of a battery; and he reminded
him that each gun which they had brought from Monte
Video was provided with 200 rounds: but all was to no
purpose. A loop-hole for an escape without utter disgrace,
as he thought, was opened to General Whitelocke, of which
he availed himself, and which he thus described in his
official report:&mdash;“On the morning of the 6th inst. General
Linières addressed a letter to me, offering to give up all
his prisoners taken in the late affair, together with the
71st Regiment and others taken with General Beresford,
if I desisted from any other attack on the town, and withdrew
His Majesty’s forces from the River Plata, intimating
at the same time, from the exasperated state of the
populace, he could not answer for the safety of the
prisoners, if I persisted in offensive measures. Influenced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
by this consideration (which I knew from better authority
to be founded on fact), and reflecting of how little advantage
would be the possession of a country, the inhabitants
of which were so absolutely hostile, I resolved to
forego the advantages which the bravery of the troops had
obtained, and acceded to the annexed Treaty, which I
trust will meet the approbation of His Majesty.”</p>

<p>It may be here mentioned that the Treaty was carried
out; the English army returning to Monte Video, and

thence to England. But as, fortunately, an immense
number of private and unpublished papers on this subject
had been accumulated by Sir A. Frazer, and ultimately
reached the Royal Artillery Record Office with a view to
embodiment in some such work as this, it seems desirable to
analyze the conduct of General Whitelocke at this crisis,
and to ascertain, as far as is practicable, whether any other
course would have been successful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Major
Nicoll’s
Diary, and
Official
Report.
Captain
Frazer’s
Diary, &amp;c.</div>

<p>First, the threat of murdering the prisoners should have
been dismissed from General Whitelocke’s mind at once.
With his powers of retaliating after any such atrocity,&mdash;being,
as he was, in possession of part of the town,&mdash;the
threat was an empty one; and between civilized communities
most unlikely of execution, even if the control of the
General had been weak. But, as a matter of fact, General
Linières’ power and popularity among the inhabitants at
the time were very great;&mdash;a rumour of his having fallen
during the day produced a profound depression, which made
the reaction of joy the more intense when it was found that
he was uninjured. That such a crime against humanity
would have been allowed by one who was admitted by all to
be chivalrous in the extreme, is utterly improbable; and
the use of the threat merely showed that he found it
necessary to make use of every argument, real and unreal,
to secure his purpose;&mdash;that his position was not sufficiently
strong to dictate terms to an enemy, even in the first hour
of his discomfiture;&mdash;and, possibly, that he measured the
man with whom he had to deal, and acted accordingly.</p>

<p>Secondly, the very eagerness of General Linières to let the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
troops go, and his ready permission to let them take all the
guns, &amp;c., which they had captured, should have suggested to
General Whitelocke that these were not the characteristics
of a General confident in his own strength, and in his
enemy’s inferiority.</p>

<p>And, thirdly, <i>were</i> the inhabitants so bitterly hostile to
the English, as General Whitelocke assumed? Doubtless
they were not likely to evince much amiability while having
to fight for their lives and homes; but, had a different mode
of attack been adopted&mdash;blockade with a threatened bombardment,
followed by the occupation in force of one or two
commanding points&mdash;would it not have been possible so to
foster English trade with the inhabitants as to ensure a
thoroughly friendly feeling? This was evidently believed
by those whose written opinions are extant&mdash;opinions formed
in the city, and after careful inquiry. They said that had
the Bishop been strictly watched, and warned that he would
be sent to Europe, should he be detected in any political
conspiracy, or countenancing any irregularity;&mdash;had all the
Spanish officers and regular troops been sent to England
immediately, and all the arms and ammunition of the inhabitants
removed;&mdash;had the chief public officers been removed,
but no injury done to the private inhabitants, and
had honesty and uprightness been displayed in the English
administration, the country might have been easily retained
as a very useful appendage to Great Britain. The presence
of an English army would have raised the price of nearly
every commodity, and at the same time the system of ready-money
payment would have benefited the local trade, and
would have given the stock-owners a very strong interest in
the presence of the English. The people of all ranks in
Buenos Ayres were fond of copying English fashions in
dress and furniture, and the facilities for comparing these
would have been favourable to the invaders. The people
born in the country, who were despised by the Spaniards,
would have been raised to a degree of consideration unknown
to them previously; and it would have been politic to place
many of them in the situations of which the Castilians had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
been deprived. As for the Indians, the gain to them would
have been immense, for their skins would have met with a
ready sale at an increased price. Commercial intercourse
between England and Buenos Ayres once established, every
vessel that sailed between their ports would have spun
another thread in the web which bound them together,
until what at first might have been a mere commercial
alliance, would have ended in a firm friendship and union.</p>

<p>All these possibilities were frustrated by the ignorance of
a General. His landing so far from the city was one great
blunder: his sub-division of his army, leaving part at Reduccion
and part at Colonia, was another: his dispensing
with siege artillery was a fatal error; and his crowning
folly was the employment of a trained soldiery in street
fighting, thus depriving them of the opportunity of exercising
the qualities which a disciplined army possesses, and
compelling them to meet an enemy under the very circumstances
which that enemy would himself have chosen.
General Whitelocke had sufficient troops to prevent the
entry of supplies into the city if he had chosen;&mdash;or he
might have entered Buenos Ayres two days before, when
there was nothing but the wildest confusion within;&mdash;or he
might have confined the attack to the side of the Ritoro, and
approached the Citadel by regular parallels, using the streets
to a great extent for that purpose, and ending by an assault
which would have certainly been successful.</p>

<p>But he took the very course which was certain to be fatal;
and the army he commanded, after performing useless prodigies
of valour, had to succumb to terms which were openly
talked of at Monte Video, while the army was awaiting embarkation
for England, as disgraceful.</p>

<p>And with this irritating consciousness of failure, there
came among the troops, when at Monte Video, not a little
demoralization. Crime was general; desertions frequent;
insubordination not unknown; and capital punishment was
resorted to to enforce discipline. It is with pride that the
Artilleryman learns from Captain Frazer’s letters, that not a
single desertion occurred from the ranks of the Royal Artillery.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span></p>

<p>The possible consequences of a General’s incapacity ought
to stir every officer to a determination to master his profession.
The thought that his ignorance may some day be
the cause of unnecessary slaughter, or may neutralise the
bravest efforts of his men, and tarnish his country’s honour,
ought to make a man afraid of being found wanting when
called upon. In the success of a great General, the officer
who loves his profession traces means and maxims which he
himself may study; and in the failures of an incapable
commander, he searches for blunders which he may avoid.
The study of both will be found useful to the man who may
some day have to lead others, and would fain lead them to
victory.</p>

<p>The last letter written by Captain Frazer from Monte
Video was one imploring that he and his troop might be
attached to any portion of the army which might be on
active service. He seemed eager to drown the recollection
of failure in the excitement of successes under some more
able leader. And, as this history will show, he was not
disappointed. The time was near when England was to
draw the sword on behalf of suffering Spain, nor to sheathe
it again until the invader had been driven from Spanish soil,
albeit at a terrible cost to herself of life and treasure. But
with all their attendant sufferings and cost, those were days
to gloat over; now, alas! is it not too often found that<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<span class="medium smcap">The Old Tenth Battalion.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> is necessary to distinguish this battalion as above,
because it was reduced after Waterloo, and another
10th Battalion added to the Regiment subsequently, in 1846.
As, however, there was no connection between the two in
any way, not even a battalion head-quarters, or a company
cadre, however small, left of the old 10th, this chapter
differs from all the preceding histories of the battalions,
in being merely a sketch of a part of the Regiment, whose
traditions can be handed down to no lineal descendant, and
are the property of the Corps at large.</p>

<p>In the year 1807 the Regiment consisted of 12 troops of
Horse Artillery, 90 marching companies, and 12 companies
of invalids, besides the Riding-house establishment, the last-named
of which had been formed in 1806. There were also
10 companies of the Driver Corps. The Board of Ordnance
decided on augmenting the Regiment by another battalion of
10 companies; and this was the last augmentation of this
description which took place during the great wars with
France. The <i>second</i> 10th Battalion, as has been stated
above, was not formed until 1846; and the others as follows:
11th and 12th Battalions in 1848; 13th Battalion in 1854;
and 14th Battalion in 1855. All the augmentations which
took place between the formation of the <i>old</i> 10th and the
Battle of Waterloo, were in the form of additional numbers
to the ranks of the existing troops and companies.</p>

<p>The receipt in Woolwich, in the winter of 1807, of 1000

of a new battalion of 10 companies, in every respect
like those already existing. The staff of the brigade was as

at Quebec on the 3rd June, accompanied by the whole of its
officers. On the 5th June it left Quebec, in boats, and arrived
at Fort George, on the Niagara River, in the end of the
month. On the 3rd July the Americans crossed the river
into Canada; and on the 5th, part of the company, with
Captain Mackonochie and Lieutenants Shipperd and Hunter,
was in action with the enemy at Chippewa. For his
conduct on this occasion, Captain Mackonochie was mentioned
<span class="sidenote">‘Annual
Register,’
1814.</span>
in despatches by General Riall. On the 10th July,
part of the company, with two field guns, under Lieutenant
Tomkyns, was engaged with the enemy near Fort George;
and was thanked in General Orders. On the 25th July, the
whole company was engaged with the Americans near
Niagara Falls, and Captain Maclachlan was severely
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.</span>
wounded, losing the use of his right arm. He, Captain
Mackonochie, and Lieutenant Tomkyns were specially
<span class="sidenote">General
Drummond’s

mentioned by General Drummond in his despatches. On
the 13th and 14th August, the company, with its three
subaltern officers, was engaged in the batteries at Fort
Erie; and on the 15th August, at the assault on the same
place. From the 16th August to 16th September, they
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
15 Aug.
1814.</span>
were engaged in the batteries at Fort Erie; and on the
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
17 Sept.
1814.</span>
17th September, assisted in repulsing a <i>sortie</i> made from the
Fort by 5000 Americans. On the 30th September, the
company, with its subaltern officers (both Captains being
sick in hospital), was engaged in repulsing a general attack
on the British lines on the Chippewa; after which the
Americans, having completely failed in obtaining possession
of Upper Canada, recrossed the Niagara River into the
United States. In October the company took part in fresh
operations at Fort George and Fort Niagara; and Lieutenant
Tomkyns, with two 6-pounders, was attached to the
37th Regiment, when sent to drive a strong party of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
Americans out of the country, who had remained on the
British side, plundering the inhabitants in the neighbourhood
of Turkey Point, on Lake Erie. In the spring of 1815,
the company was sent to Amherstburg; on the 23rd July,
1817, it returned to England; and on the 31st of the same
month it ceased to exist.</p>

<p><i>No. 2 Company.</i>&mdash;This company, under Captain Lloyd,
and with 2nd Captain Marlow, 1st Lieutenants Baker and
Wells, and 2nd Lieutenant Manners, took part in the Expedition
to Walcheren in 1809. Its next foreign service
was very important. It embarked at Plymouth on 14th
January, 1815, and sailed for Cork to join the fleet destined
for the American Coast: after remaining there ten weeks it
proceeded to sea; but the second day after doing so, it
received counter orders to proceed to Ostend, where it
arrived in the end of April.</p>

<p>The company, with Captains Lloyd and Rudyerd, and Lieutenants
Wells, Phelps, and Harvey, was engaged against the
French on the 16th, 17th, and 18th June, commencing at
Quatre Bras and ending at Waterloo. During these engagements,
Captain Lloyd was mortally wounded, and died at
Brussels on the 29th July following; and Lieutenant Harvey
lost his right arm. To any one familiar with the story of
the Artillery at Waterloo, the subsequent reduction of this
gallant company seems almost a crime. It accompanied the
army into France, where it remained until March 1816;
returning then to England, it disembarked at Ramsgate, and
proceeded to Woolwich, where, on the 28th April, 1817, it
fell a victim to the reductions which economy rendered
necessary, but which the Artilleryman must always bitterly
regret.</p>

<p><i>No. 3 Company.</i>&mdash;This company, with Captain Adams, 1st
Lieutenants Otway and Moore, and 2nd Lieutenant Weston,
took part in the Expedition to Walcheren in 1809.</p>

<p>On the 16th March, 1814, the company, with Captains
Adams and King, 1st Lieutenant Day, and 2nd Lieutenant
Pickard, embarked at Portsmouth for North America, and
disembarked at Quebec on the 30th May. In the July following
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
Captain King and Lieutenant Pickard, with part of
the company, were ordered to march to Chambly, where
they were attached to a battery of 6-pounder field guns, for
duty with that part of the army serving under Major-General
De Rottenburg. In the beginning of August, this detachment,
with two 6-pounders, and one 5½-inch howitzer, was
ordered to the frontier to act with the army under the command
of General De Watterville; and on the 4th September
it moved forward with the army commanded by Lieut.-General
Sir George Prevost to Plattsburg, at which place
it was removed from its field guns, and posted to a battery
of two 8-inch mortars, for service against the American lines
and gun-boats. From this place the army retreated on the
11th September. No part of the company was engaged subsequent
to this date; and the head-quarters remained at
Montreal, under Captain Adams. On the 17th June, 1817, it
embarked at Quebec for England, landing at Woolwich on
the 23rd July. On the 31st of the same month, the company
was reduced.</p>

<p><i>No. 4 Company.</i>&mdash;If regret is unavoidable when one reads of
the reduction of the companies already mentioned, a much
stronger feeling inspires the Artilleryman&mdash;a feeling of
righteous indignation,&mdash;when he finds that this, Sir Alexander
Dickson’s own company, shared the same fate. Just as its
Captain&mdash;in his position of confidential adviser to the Duke of
Wellington&mdash;raised the position of an Artillery commander on
service, so did the company, under its gallant 2nd Captain,
Cairnes&mdash;who was killed afterwards at Waterloo&mdash;contribute
no mean share to the meed of glory, and work well done,
which attached to the representatives of the Corps in the
Peninsular campaigns. What battery is there now in existence,
but would give a great price to be able to say that the
following records of No. 4 Company, 10th Battalion, were its
own property by right of uninterrupted descent? And yet,
perhaps, it is well that praise, earned in such words as recognized
the labours of Sir Alexander Dickson’s company, should
be viewed as a regimental, instead of a battery inheritance.
Let the record be briefly stated.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

<p>In February 1810, the company embarked at Woolwich on
board the troop ship ‘Alert,’ and disembarked at Cadiz on
the 1st April. The officers of the company present with it
were Lieutenants Woolcombe, Raynes, and Talbot; 2nd
Captain Cairnes joined it in June 1810, and Lieutenant
Bridges in September 1811. It was stationed at the Isla de
Leon during the siege of Cadiz, taking its tour of duty in
the advanced batteries. The blockade continued from April
1810 to August 1812. In the beginning of 1811, 30 non-commissioned
officers and gunners, with small arms, were
told off under Lieutenant Mainwaring, Acting Quartermaster,
as an escort to the ammunition accompanying the
expedition under Lieut.-General Graham, which resulted in
the battle of Barossa, on 5th March, 1811. This detachment
was present at that battle, as were also Captain Cairnes and
Lieutenant Raynes, who were attached to Major Roberts’
brigade of guns; and Lieutenant Woolcombe, who acted as
Adjutant to Major Duncan, who commanded the Artillery.
Lieutenant Woolcombe was mortally wounded, and died on
the following day.</p>

<p>In the month of September 1812, Colonel Skerrett was
ordered to join Lord Wellington’s army with 4000 men of
the Cadiz division. Captain Cairnes with the whole of the
company marched from the Isla de Leon on the 12th September,
and on their arrival at Seville they were posted to a
brigade of 9-pounders. Captain Cairnes, having been severely
wounded by the explosion of a powder-mill near Seville a few
days previously to the march of the division, was left behind.
The brigade, under the command of Lieutenant Raynes,
marched from Seville on the 30th September, and joined the
army under Lieut.-General Hill at Val de Moros. On 30th
October it was present at the affair of Puente Largo, near
Aranjuez, but was not engaged. At the close of this year’s
campaign, the brigade was stationed at Val de la Mula, on
the Portuguese frontier. Here it was rejoined by Captain
Cairnes, and shortly afterwards moved to Pena ma Cor.</p>

<p>On the 6th June, 1813, the brigade joined the 7th Division
of the army at Villalba, the following officers being present
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
with it: Captain Cairnes, Lieutenants Raynes, Bridges,
Talbot, and James, and Assist.-Surgeon Kenny. It was
present at the battle of Vittoria, and received the following
mention in orders<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The Lieut.-General desires to express his high admiration
of the conduct of the 1st Brigade, and of Captain
Cairnes’ brigade of guns yesterday. Nothing could surpass
the steadiness and bravery of the men and officers. To
Captain Cairnes, the officers, and men of the brigade of
guns, the Lieut.-General offers his warmest acknowledgments
for the steadiness and excellence of their fire at the
different points where Captain Cairnes brought it to bear
during the day.</p>

</p>

<p>The brigade was afterwards employed in the blockade of
Pampeluna in conjunction with the Spanish troops. On the
27th July, the right wing being driven back from Roncesvalles,
after a series of actions commencing on the 25th,
Captain Cairnes’ brigade was ordered to take up a position
on the heights near the village of Oracain, commanding the
high road to Pampeluna. On the 28th July, the Artillery of
the 6th Division not having arrived, Lieutenants Raynes and
James were detached with two guns to the support of that
division; and during the action Lieutenant Talbot joined
with another gun. General Packe, who commanded the
division, stood near the guns, and afterwards was pleased to
say: “The guns were brought up at a most critical moment,
and served with all that gallantry for which the Corps is
remarkable.” On the 29th July, this detachment rejoined
Captain Cairnes, who was ordered to take up a fresh position,
and on the following day an action commenced at daybreak.
The enemy had previously endeavoured to surprise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
the advanced posts, but was soon driven back. The brigade
was heavily engaged from daybreak till noon, when the
enemy, driven back at all points, retreated. These two
actions of the 28th and 30th July formed part of what are
known as the “Battles of the Pyrenees.” The brigade remained
in the neighbourhood of Pampeluna until the 1st
November, when the place surrendered.</p>

<p>On the 10th November, the brigade was present at the
battle of Nivelle&mdash;held in reserve. On the 20th of the same
month, it was ordered to the rear and cantoned near
Fuenterabia, where it remained during the winter. In consequence
of a deficiency of horses for the pontoon train,
those belonging to the brigade were given up for that
service.</p>

<p>On the 11th February, 1814, Captain Cairnes having been
appointed to the Royal Horse Artillery, the command of the
company fell to Lieutenant Raynes. On the 19th February,
it marched to St. Jean de Luz, to take charge of rockets to
be given over to Captain Lane.</p>

<p>On the 22nd February, Lieutenant Raynes received the
following order<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Lieutenant Raynes with three non-commissioned officers
and 4 gunners, with spikes, will cross with the first party,
and spike the guns of the battery at the mouth of the
Adour; which being accomplished, Lieutenant Raynes will
return to the left bank of the Adour, and take charge of
the rocket detachments on that side, which will have been
previously told off as follows, viz.:</p>

<p>“One half to be employed against the ‘Sappho’ frigate:
for this duty, Lieutenant Bridges.</p>

<p>“The other half against the enemy’s vessels, should any
attempt to come down the river: for this post, Lieutenant
Elgee.</p>

<p>“The parties under Lieutenants Bridges and Elgee to
accompany the 18-pounders on their march. Lieutenant
Raynes to accompany the pontoons.</p>

<p>“22 February, 1814.”<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

<p>On the 23rd February, the passage of the Adour took place.
The company remained before Bayonne until 8th March,
when it was ordered to Reuterix (Spain) to assist in preparing
the battering-train for the proposed siege of Bayonne.</p>

<p>On the 11th June Captain Close joined and took command
of the company; and on the 20th of the same month it embarked
for England,&mdash;disembarking on 12th July at Woolwich,
and proceeding to Chatham.</p>

<p>It should have been mentioned that when the company
was not actively employed, its officers often volunteered for
other services. For example, from October 1811 to February
1812, Lieutenant Raynes was employed with another company
at the siege of Tarifa. Lieutenants Bridges and Talbot,
also, took part in the Expedition to Carthagena.</p>

<p>The company went from Chatham to Ireland, and was
reduced, while serving in that country, on the 31st May,
1817.</p>

<p><i>No. 5 Company.</i>&mdash;This company embarked at Woolwich
on 28th February, 1810, for Cadiz, and landed at that place
on the 1st April. The officers who accompanied it were
Captain Shenley, 2nd Captain Mallett, 1st Lieutenants
Maitland and Godby, and 2nd Lieutenant Cator. The
company was employed in the batteries and lines in the
defence of Cadiz until June 1812, when the French abandoned
the siege. On the 16th August, 1814, it embarked
at Cadiz for England, and landed at Woolwich on 27th
September, 1814. On the 28th February, 1818, it ceased to
exist.</p>

<p><i>No. 6 Company.</i>&mdash;This company embarked at Gravesend
on 28th February, 1810, for Cadiz, and landed there on
1st April. The company was employed in the batteries
and lines in the defence of Cadiz until the abandonment
of the siege by the French in June 1812. The officers with
the company were Captain Roberts, 1st Lieutenants Dundas
and Cozens. During the siege Lieutenant Cozens lost a
leg. Part of the company, under Captain Roberts, was
detached in February 1811 on an expedition to Algaziras,
and afterwards was present at the battle of Barossa.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
Second Captain Gardiner joined the company in 1811, but
exchanged shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>On the 9th August, 1812, part of the company, under
Captain Roberts, with Lieutenants Raynes, Maitland, and
Brett attached, embarked at Cadiz with a brigade of 6-pounders
under the command of Colonel Skerritt, and was
present at the taking of Seville on the 27th of the same
month. Here Lieutenant Brett was killed, and Lieutenant
Maitland so severely wounded that he died a few weeks
after. From Seville the detachment returned to Cadiz,
where on the 16th August, 1814, they embarked for England
with the whole company, arriving at Woolwich on the
27th September, 1814. The company was reduced after
Waterloo on the 31st March, 1817.</p>

<p><i>No. 7 Company.</i>&mdash;This company served in Gibraltar from
March 1810 to April 1817. On its return to Woolwich,
it was reduced,&mdash;on 31st May, 1817. Its reduction dislocated
no traditions.</p>

<p><i>No. 8 Company.</i>&mdash;The history of this company tallies, even
to the dates of embarkation, with that of No. 7.</p>

<p><i>No. 9 Company.</i>&mdash;This company served at the Cape of
Good Hope from March 1811 to August 1817. It was
reduced at Woolwich on 31st December, 1817.</p>

<p><i>No. 10 Company.</i>&mdash;This company served in Malta from
December 1810 to March 1817. It was reduced while in
Malta, the men being transferred to the 1st Battalion, to
a company which is now called A Battery, 11th Brigade,
Royal Artillery.</p>

<p>The battalion head-quarters and Adjutant’s detachment
were reduced on 28th February, 1818.</p>

<p>This summary of the history of the old 10th Battalion
companies should be read in connection with, and in amplification
of, the chapters on the Peninsular and Second
American Wars.

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> history of the Regiment between 1808 and 1814 is
concentrated in the Peninsular campaigns,&mdash;with the one
exception of the Expedition to Walcheren. As the war in
Spain drew to a close, the Second American War, which had
in the meantime arisen, increased in importance, reaching
its culminating point in 1814.</p>

<p>It is proposed in this chapter to treat of that section of
the wars in the Peninsula, which terminated in the sad but
glorious victory of Corunna. After a diversion on the
subject of the Walcheren Expedition, the Peninsular narrative
will be resumed, and be continued uninterruptedly to
its close.</p>

<p>The reader will doubtless remember that in the spring
of 1808 the Spaniards rose as one man to resist the schemes
of Napoleon, who had placed his brother Joseph on the
throne of Spain. The English Government, always ready
to assist any country which defied the French emperor,
placed a force of 9000 men under the command of Sir Arthur
Wellesley, who sailed for Portugal on the 12th July, to co-operate
with the Spanish forces. This force was subsequently
increased to nearly 30,000; but the conflicting
instructions given by Government, and the utter ignorance
of the real state of affairs in Spain, prevented the possibility
of harmony of action among the English forces, and had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
ultimately much to do with the abrupt and mistaken Convention
of Cintra. Portugal had recently suffered dismemberment
at the hands of Napoleon as a penalty for its friendship
with England; the English expedition had therefore a double
motive,&mdash;the delivery of Portugal, and co-operation with the
Spaniards. How terrible the errors of the English Government
were in organizing this Expedition can only be
<span class="sidenote">Napier,

i., chapter
iii.</span>
realised by a study of the celebrated and standard history of
the war; and such a study is necessary to enable one fully to
realise the marvellous genius of Wellington, and his determined
vigour. It is sufficient for the purpose of this work
to show that, if the Royal Artillery shared the glories of
Wellington, they also from the very first shared his difficulties&mdash;which
were certainly not lessened in their treatment
by the Ordnance. The conflicting instructions given by
Government to Sir Arthur Wellesley were matched by the
total absence of any information from the Board to Colonel
Robe, who had been appointed to command the Artillery of
the Expedition. A man full of zeal&mdash;one of the best practical
Artillerymen whom the Regiment has ever produced&mdash;he
naturally sought by every means in his power to ensure
the completeness in every respect of the equipment of the
force under his control. How completely he was foiled by
the masterly silence of the Board will be seen by the following
letters written by him after his arrival in Portugal.
That, in spite of all his difficulties, he succeeded in earning
the warm commendations of a chief, who was rarely guilty of
many words of praise, is merely another instance of the truth
<span class="sidenote">‘Times,’
13 Jan.
1873.</span>
of the saying of a recent writer: “The student who reads
the history of the Royal Artillery can hardly fail to be
struck by proof after proof that the progress of the Regiment
has been due to the energy and manly courage of
individual officers within its ranks in spite of the withering
cold of officialism.... So it must be, and ever will be.
Boards and clerks will bind chains in peace round the
men of talent, who will either break them when a crisis
comes, or die in the effort to do so.”</p>

<p>The correspondence was as follows.

<p>“... I shall therefore take the liberty of mentioning to
you some points which it may be essential should on future
occasions be put right on the embarkation of Artillery....
It appears to me necessary that the officer appointed
to command Artillery on any expedition should know
something more of the nature of the service intended than
I did, and that he should not be made to take upon trust
that everything necessary for his service will be found on
board his ships. Our equipment is not yet arrived at the
state of perfection to render such a mode efficient; and if
it is practised, the commanding officer of Artillery will
find, as I have, that his brigades will be wanting in articles
extremely necessary, and be very short indeed in stores
intended for repair or for keeping them in good order.
He will perhaps find also, as I have, that intrenching
tools, and even platforms, are sent with the Engineer’s
department for a species of service for which he has not a
gun, nor a mortar, nor a round of ammunition. I do not
make this a matter of complaint to you. I complain not
of anything, because I can go no further than use to the
best of my ability the means put into my power; but I
confess it would have been much more satisfactory to me
had I been permitted an opportunity of stating before I
embarked what might have been sent with me for the
real benefit of the service, and I don’t think it would have
occasioned an hour’s delay to the embarkation, or have
added a shilling of expense to the country, because the
essential articles, if not supplied, <i>must</i> be purchased.
I have so often mentioned <i>horses</i> that I ought perhaps to
apologise for again recurring to that subject; and perhaps
it may be said that I have no reason to mention them,
having the horses of the Irish Commissariat ordered to be
turned over to me on landing. Fortunate, indeed, I think
myself to have even <i>them</i>. I know not what figure we
should have cut without them; but when you learn that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
they are acknowledged to be <i>cast horses from the Cavalry</i>
turned over to the Commissariat, you will readily think
that we are not likely to make a very capital figure with
them. I have been also fortunate enough to obtain with
them a promise of shoes from that branch, sufficient,
with the <i>one hundred sets</i> supplied to me, to shoe them on
first going off. Future service must be supplied as it can,
and I shall not let it go unsupplied.” ...</p>

<p>This letter was written by Colonel Robe before he had
realised the whole of his wants, and how admirably the
Honourable Board had succeeded in proving their ability
“How not to do it.” The truth dawned on him very soon,
and his language of remonstrance became stronger. His
next letter is dated the 7th August, 1808, from the camp
above Lavos, Mondego Bay, and contains the following
passages<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lieut.-Col.
Robe to
Brig.-Gen.
Macleod.</div>

<p>“I now deem it my duty (which were I to neglect I should
be highly culpable) to point out to you in the strongest
manner the impolicy of sending Artillery to a foreign
country without horses. Even the horses we have now,
old, blind, and casts from the Cavalry as they are, we find
superior to what we can obtain from the country. The
latter are good of their kind, but small, and not of sufficient
weight for our carriages. Three hundred good horses would
have cost the country no more for transport than as many
bad ones, and what we shall do for the brigade now to be
landed remains to be decided.... I must also mention
the proportion of general stores which you, sir, know
Artillery cannot do without, and which ought to be sent
out with every embarkation. Had I been made acquainted
with what was to have been embarked, I should
not have gone on board ship till the proper proportion
had been furnished. <i>I did everything in my power to obtain
the information from the Board, and was referred to Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;, who himself at the time was not furnished with any
information.</i> I did at hazard request Mr. Spencer to put
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
on board one hundred sets of horse-shoes and some nails,
thinking them an addition to what would be provided
for us. <i>These are all I have had for the horses of three
brigades</i>; and had I not obtained some more from the
Commissary-General, belonging to the horses delivered
to us, the horses must have taken the field <i>barefoot</i>. I
have made demands for some, and for such things as are
most immediately required, and what may be wanted in the
meantime must be purchased here.</p>

<p>“I write this to you officially, and must not be considered
as individually complaining or making difficulties. My
people of all classes exert themselves, and I am determined
to get on; but I know that, engaged in a department
where much is expected, I am doing my country greater
service by pointing out what may render that department
as complete as it is supposed to be, than if I were to
remain for ever silent on the subject.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then followed the battles of Roliça and Vimiera, to be
alluded to hereafter, and merely mentioned here to show
that before the date of his next letter Colonel Robe had
been able to form a very practical opinion of the Board’s
shortcomings. Writing after Vimiera, on the night of the
<span class="sidenote">Lieut.-Col.
Robe to
Brigadier
Macleod.</span>
21st August, 1808, he says: “My men are staunch, and the
admiration of the army; and had they been properly supplied
with horses and with stores, as artillery <i>should have</i>
embarked from England, Europe would not have produced
a more efficient artillery. I shall have occasion to write
to you and to the Board on the latter subjects, as soon as
I can obtain time; but give me leave to say now that
never more will I leave England taking my provision of
Artillery upon trust, and coming upon an army burthened
with cast horses, or no horses at all, or with brigades
unsupplied with any one store to make repair, and scarce
a shoe to put on horses when I could beg them. This may
be strong; but I have reason to use the expressions after
suffering the inconveniences occasioned by the want of
these supplies.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lieut.-Col.
Robe to
Colonel
Harding.</div>

<p>On the 1st September, 1808, Colonel Robe pointed out to
Colonel Harding, who had arrived to take command of the
Artillery in Portugal, that “not less than two hundred and
fifty horses would be required to render that Artillery
efficient for taking the field for a length of service. Those
received originally from the Irish Commissariat were old
cast horses of Cavalry, and many of them blind. They
now fall off very fast.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The reader will be eager to see how the Board explained
its shortcomings, and what reparation it proposed to make
to the brave officer, who had gained honour for his Corps in
spite of official blunders. For calm, cool assumption, perhaps,
<span class="sidenote">Board of
Ordnance
to Lieut.-Col.
Robe.</span>
the reply sent by the Board is unsurpassed. It bears
date the 6th October, 1808, after the news of the English
successes, and the gallantry of the Artillery under Colonel
Robe, had reached England, and after Colonel Robe had been
twice specially mentioned by Sir A. Wellesley in his despatches.
It was written, let the reader remember, on behalf
of a Board whose errors were not confined to those quoted
above; which had actually sent guns without their ammunition,
and ammunition which would have been useless, had
not Colonel Robe succeeded in borrowing suitable guns from
the navy. It was addressed to an officer who had been
straining every nerve, night and day, to remedy the defects
due to official ignorance, or to what is much the same, official
affectation of omniscience;&mdash;to an officer who, in spite of the
remonstrances which had been extorted from him by his
discovery of the Board’s incapacity, had never attempted to
shelter himself behind the faults of others, but had, instead,
toiled to remedy them. Let the reader bear these facts in
mind, as he attempts to realise the feelings with which
Colonel Robe must have perused the following lines:&mdash;“In
reply to the parts of your public correspondence in
which you have so very warmly complained of some
omissions and deficiencies, particularly in the Light Brigade
of Artillery shipped at Plymouth, I am to say that
his Lordship has, upon inquiry, ascertained that there <i>were</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
<i>some irregularities</i> in the embarkation, and that he has, in
consequence, expressed his displeasure through the Board
to the parties concerned, in a manner to make a lasting
impression. His Lordship has, besides, issued such orders,
and made such regulations, as must effectually preclude
every plea or excuse for irregularity or omission in future.</p>

<p>“The Master-General, in desiring me to give you the
above information, has directed me to add that, although
he is willing to ascribe much of the style and many of the
expressions in the letters to your known zeal for the service,
and the anxiety attending an officer during the moments
of preparation for the field, yet his Lordship cannot but
regret that, instead of forwarding a complaint, which it
would be the wish and the interest of the Ordnance to
attend to, you should have allowed yourself to arraign,
with such improper and unmerited asperity, the conduct
of the Ordnance Department in general.”</p>

<p>The old, old story! Officialism, on being detected in error,
hurriedly, and with attempts at dignity, assumes an air of
injured innocence, and neither forgives nor forgets the unhappy
soldier who is the means of revealing its shortcomings.
What a contrast does Colonel Robe’s dignified and soldierlike
acknowledgment of this reprimand present! Having first
acknowledged the congratulations of the Master-General on
the conduct of the Artillery at Roliça and Vimiera, which
he had caused to be read to the men on parade, and entered
in all the order-books, thereby, as he wrote, “awakening
every joyful feeling that could arise in the breasts of
<span class="sidenote">Lisbon,
7 Jan.
1809.</span>
soldiers,” he proceeded as follows:&mdash;“The latter part of
your letter is indeed a great source of grief to me, and
has hurt me more than I can express. I had hoped to
have obtained for my whole conduct the approbation of his
Lordship the Master-General and the Board of Ordnance.
I set out with the most earnest desire to fulfil, to the
extent of my abilities, every duty I might be honoured
with, and to abide in the strictest manner by their orders,
for which purpose I applied for instructions and such
information as the very limited time prior to my departure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
would admit. The shortness of that time, our expected
destination (which, as you know, we had reason to believe
was far more distant than it proved afterwards to be<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>)
certainly produced in me an anxiety that the branch of
service entrusted to me should be supplied in the manner
most conducive to the end for which it was sent out. This
anxiety may have caused a warmth of expression not
deemed advisable in public correspondence, however good
the intention. And that an unfavourable impression has
been received in His Lordship’s mind I, with pain, perceive,
and submit in the most respectful manner to the
animadversion you have received His Lordship’s commands
to make.... Whatever the warmth of my feelings
might have been which impelled me to the remarks that
have caused His Lordship’s displeasure, I entreat that
they may be ascribed to the peculiar situation in which I
was placed. My letter to you was written on the ground
of, and almost during, the action, and, consequently, that
degree of coolness was not attended to which ought to
have been manifested.”</p>

<p>The difficulties of the campaign of August 1808 were
increased by the insincerity and disunion of the Spaniards,
the feebleness of the Portuguese support, and the extraordinary
conduct of the English Government in sending General
after General with conflicting instructions. The supersession
of Sir Arthur Wellesley at a critical moment, uncalled
for and undeserved, would have paralysed a less determined
commander. To his resolution, his singleness of purpose, and
his tact in dealing with the Portuguese authorities, is the
fact due that, brief as the campaign was, it was marked by
two brilliant engagements, and established already the military
reputation of the English troops. The British army
in Portugal, in 1808, was gathered from the four winds of
heaven, without harmony either in instructions or management,
and destitute of adequate equipment or supplies. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
main body, which sailed from Cork, had been intended for
South America; the contingent brought by Sir John Moore
had been sent in the first instance to Sweden, on an errand
rendered fruitless by the obstinacy of the Swedish monarch;
and the rest of the army was gathered in instalments from
Gibraltar, Madeira, and various parts of England. The
annexed table, prepared from the embarkation returns,
shows the method in which the Artillery portion of the army
was collected:&mdash;at first destitute of horses, and, later, embarked
with so much precipitation, that in many instances
the horses died from long confinement on board ship; and in
others it was found that animals had been hurriedly purchased,
and embarked afflicted with fatal and infectious
diseases, which spread rapidly among those which were
healthy. The horses which were purchased in the country
were small, and unfitted for Artillery work. The roads
round Lisbon, and in the district traversed by Sir A. Wellesley’s
force, were of the worst description; and Colonel
Robe and his successor, Colonel Harding, wrote to the Board,
expressing their thankfulness that, for the three brigades
engaged at Roliça and Vimiera they had been able to procure
<i>oxen</i> to draw the guns, with horses as leaders! The
remonstrances of Colonel Robe and his successors succeeded
in procuring from England, as the annexed table will show,
a suitable supply of horses as the year advanced; but the
honours gained by the Corps had been earned before these
arrived (<a href="#Page_204"><i>see</i> p. 204</a>).</p>

<p>In addition to the companies (Captain Geary’s and Captain
Raynsford’s) which embarked with Colonel Robe to form
part of Sir A. Wellesley’s force, 161 of the King’s German
Artillery were also detailed. The services of this Corps
during the Peninsular and Waterloo campaigns were of the
highest order. The head-quarters of the Corps were at
this time at Porchester, and the strength in 1808 was as

<p>N.B. The return given by Napier in vol. 1. p. 590, of his ‘History,’ neither includes the R. A. drivers, nor the officers and N. C. officers of the R. A. of several of the
detachments mentioned above, but merely the gunners. It, however, does include the King’s German Artillery, which is not shown in this purely regimental return.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span></p>

<p>Four marching companies, in all 714 officers and men&mdash;with
67 horses.</p>

<p>One of these companies was stationed in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>An addition to Colonel Robe’s force of a doubtful value
was received from Gibraltar. Lieut.-Colonel George Ramsey
was ordered from Gibraltar with three companies to meet
the Artillery expected from England, and a <i>car brigade</i> of
guns, as it was termed, was issued from the Ordnance stores,
for the service. Two of the companies, and Colonel Ramsey,
were sent back to Gibraltar immediately on their arrival in
Cadiz:&mdash;only one, Captain Morison’s<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> being allowed to proceed
in charge of the guns. Colonel Ramsey, however, had
time to inspect the car brigade which had been issued to
him, and his official report on it was not complimentary to
<span class="sidenote">To D. A. G.
from Cadiz,

the store-keepers. A similar brigade, it would appear, had
been sent to Sicily, a few weeks before; and the clerk of
stores had hopelessly confused the two. The shafts for the
howitzers had been sent with the 6-pounders; seven gun-wheels
had been put on board for use with the waggons,&mdash;although
not interchangeable,&mdash;and one waggon was entirely
useless. The stores were inadequate and unsuitable; and
there was neither a commissary, nor an artificer, with the
detachment. A little further vacillation on the part of the
authorities led to two companies leaving Gibraltar for Portugal
immediately after the return of those under Colonel
<span class="sidenote">Now
1 Battery,
6 Brigade.</span>
Ramsey; and one of these, Captain Skyring’s, had the good
fortune to join Colonel Robe in time for the battle of Vimiera.</p>

<p>Colonel Robe’s force anchored in Mondego Bay on 28th
July; and on the following day Sir Arthur Wellesley, who
had preceded the army, and had been engaged in diplomatic
as well as military duties, arrived, and gave orders for the
disembarkation. The French withdrew from the coast, and
the inhabitants showed symptoms of co-operation with the
English, which were, however, sadly neutralised by the
conduct of their rulers; while Sir A. Wellesley pressed forward,
on the 9th August, to Leiria, hoping to cover the disembarkation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
of the additional troops which he now knew
were on their way from England, and perhaps at the same
time to strike an effective blow, as near to Lisbon as possible,
with the force under his command. This would have the
effect of inspiring the Portuguese with courage; of asserting
the right of the English to control the military operations
of the Allies; and of disarranging the plans of the French.
The English army was augmented at Lavos on the 6th
August by General Spencer’s contingent; and was divided
into six brigades, under Generals Hill, Nightingale, Crawford,
<span class="sidenote">G. O. dated
Lavos,
7 Aug.
1808.</span>
Bowes, Ferguson, and Fane. A demi-battery of Artillery was
attached to each brigade; howitzers being attached to the
1st, 2nd, 5th, and 6th Brigades, and the 9-pounders being
kept in reserve. On the line of march, the Artillery always
moved in front of the brigades to which they were attached,
and the Artillery of the reserve followed the Infantry.</p>

<p>The advance of Sir Arthur Wellesley was perfectly successful;
he succeeded in cutting the line of communication
between Generals Loison and Laborde, and in inducing the
French Commander-in-Chief, Junot, to quit Lisbon, and take
the field with the reserve. The cowardice and self-interest
of the Portuguese leaders robbed him, however, at a critical
moment, of several thousand troops; so that in his first
engagement with the enemy he had the assistance of no
more than 1650 Portuguese. That engagement was the one
known as the combat of Roliça&mdash;fought on the 17th August,
with superior numbers on the side of the English, but against
a General, Laborde, who was not only very able, but also
occupied a position of great natural strength.</p>

<p>The attack of the English, who, with the Portuguese, numbered
14,000, was made in three columns, the left commanded
by General Ferguson,&mdash;the right composed of the
Portuguese,&mdash;and the centre, consisting of three brigades,
commanded by Sir Arthur in person. The Royal Artillery
had 18 guns, one half of which came into action to cover the
advance of the Infantry. So determined was that advance,
and so critical did General Laborde’s position become, as the
left column, under General Ferguson, closed in upon his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
right, that he fell back to a new and parallel position, on
the heights of Zambugeira. The steep heights, and dense
brushwood, which had to be traversed in the advance of the
English, rendered the attack of this new position a more
difficult and costly one, and the losses of the 9th, 29th, and
82nd Regiments were especially heavy. The ardour of the
troops was, however, irresistible; and Laborde again fell
back, handling his troops with the utmost skill. In a very
short time, after one or two attempts to make a stand, the
<span class="sidenote">Napier.</span>
French were in full retreat&mdash;“leaving three guns on the field
of battle, and the road to Torres Vedras open to the victors.”</p>

<p>The loss of the French was admitted by themselves to be
<span class="sidenote">Wellington
Supplementary
Despatches,
vol. vi.
p. 116.</span>
600 killed and wounded; but it was probably much greater.
Sir Arthur Wellesley, writing on the following day, said
the loss had been reported to be 1500; and Colonel Robe,
in his despatch to the Ordnance, said that the loss of the
French far exceeded that of the English, which amounted
to 479 killed and wounded. The loss of the Royal Artillery
on this occasion was, as Colonel Robe wrote, irreparable.
Captain Henry Geary, an officer of great promise and experience,
<span class="sidenote">Col. Robe
to D. A.
Gen., R.A.
18 August,
1808.</span>
was killed. “He was, by his own desire, and as
senior Captain, in charge of guns with the Light Brigade,
and was killed while pointing his gun within one or two
hundred yards of the enemy. I regret him as an officer,
for he was invaluable; and as a friend and old fellow-campaigner,
by no means less. His loss to his family
cannot be appreciated; but it will always be a comfort
that he died as he had lived, in the very act of doing his
<span class="sidenote">Napier,
vol i.
p. 591.</span>
duty to his country, and a true Christian.” The force of
Artillery under Colonel Robe’s command at Roliça numbered
660 of all ranks.</p>

<p>The next engagement between the French and English
forces took place under singular circumstances. Sir Arthur
Wellesley had been reinforced by the brigades under Generals
Ackland and Anstruther,&mdash;thus bringing his force up to
16,000 men, besides 660 Artillery, and 240 Cavalry,&mdash;exclusive
of the Portuguese under Colonel Trant. The greatest
number which Junot could bring against this army could&mdash;it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
was known&mdash;hardly exceed 14,000. Further English
reinforcements being known to be on the way, Sir A. Wellesley
decided on assuming the offensive. Unfortunately,
Sir H. Burrard, one of the three Generals sent out by the
English Government to assume the command, arrived on the
night of the 20th August, and Sir A. Wellesley was obliged
to wait on him for orders. No arguments that he could
employ could persuade Sir H. Burrard to attack before the
arrival of the expected reinforcements; and Sir Arthur
parted from him with feelings of the most bitter disappointment.
Fortunately for him, and for the army, Junot, who
by this time had reached Torres Vedras, resolved himself
to assume the offensive; and to attack the English in their
position near the village of Vimiera. The battle commenced
at seven o’clock on the morning of the 21st August, and
deserves a special mention in this work. For at Vimiera,
for the first time, as Napier and Oust show, did the French
realise the difference between the English forces and those
with whom they had hitherto been contending;&mdash;for the first
time did they appreciate those qualities with which they
were so soon to be familiar: “the stolid firmness and resolute
thrust of the Infantry, and the wonderful skill and
precision of the Artillery.” No chronicler of this battle
fails to speak of the “murderous fire of Robe’s Artillery;”&mdash;a
fire which told with admirable effect at the most critical
periods of the engagement. The number of guns present
was small,&mdash;only 18, as at Roliça; but on this occasion all
were engaged,&mdash;the reserve as well as the divisional Artillery
being brought into play.</p>

<p>The right wing of the English army consisted of the 1st
Brigade, under General Hill; the centre, of the 6th and 7th,
under Generals Fane and Anstruther; the left, of the 2nd,
3rd, 4th, and 8th, under Generals Ferguson, Nightingale,
Bowes, and Ackland; and the reserve was composed of the
5th Brigade, under General Crawford.</p>

<p>The attack of the French was made with great gallantry,
in spite of many difficulties caused by the broken and wooded
nature of the ground, and was directed against the English
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
centre in the first instance, and mainly against General
Fane’s brigade. That officer, wisely availing himself of a
discretionary power granted him, and seeing that the position
was a favourable one for the employment of his Artillery
against the advancing columns, brought up the guns of the
reserve at once, and with those of his own division formed
<span class="sidenote">Cust.</span>
a battery, which played on the advancing foe with “such a
shower of shell and grape as might have been sufficient
to stop any troops;” and although the French troops <i>did</i>
reach the summit of the hill on which the English stood,
they were, as Napier writes, so “shattered by the terrible
fire of Robe’s Artillery,” that they fell an easy prey to the
gallant charges of the 50th Regiment. At another part of
the line, where skirmishing between Anstruther’s brigade
and the French was going on, the Artillery played an equally
important part. A column of Grenadiers had been sent
forward by Kellermann to share in this part of the battle,
<span class="sidenote">Napier.</span>
and “coming at a brisk pace, these choice soldiers beat
back the advanced companies of the 43rd Regiment; but
to avoid Robe’s artillery, which ransacked their left, they
dipped a little into the ravine on the right, and were
immediately taken on the other flank by the guns of the
4th and 8th Brigades; then, when the narrowness of the
way, and the sweep of the round shot, were crushing and
disordering their ranks, the 43rd, rallying in one mass,
went down upon the very head of the column, and with
a short but fierce struggle, drove it back in confusion.”
Yet again: in the attack upon General Ferguson’s brigade
made by Solignac, who expected to find a weak force on
the left to oppose him,&mdash;but found it strengthened with the
same forethought and skill as marked, in days coming on,
the tactics of Wellington at Waterloo,&mdash;we read of the
“powerful artillery which swept away their foremost ranks.”
As the reader finishes the account of this battle, and reads
of the French retreating in confusion, leaving thirteen of
their guns on the field, he can scarcely realise that the
whole Artillery force of Sir A. Wellesley was little more
than the captured guns represented. How much of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
effect of this force, small as it was, was due to the individual
exertions of all ranks may be gathered from the following
extract from Colonel Robe’s despatch to the Ordnance:&mdash;“Never
<span class="sidenote">Col. Robe to
D. A. Gen.
Vimiera,
21 Aug.
1808.</span>
was man better supported by his officers and soldiers
than I have been. I would not change one of them,
from the Major to the youngest subaltern, for anything
in the world; and only regret my son was not with me.
My men are staunch and the admiration of the army.”
It may interest the professional reader to know that great
part of Colonel Robe’s report after Vimiera was occupied
with praises of Shrapnel’s spherical case, of which he begged
large additional supplies. He concludes with a sentence
which proves the <i>entente cordiale</i> which existed between
himself and his superiors. “Nothing but the unexampled
assistance and attention of Sir A. Wellesley, and the
general officers, could have brought this artillery into the
field in an efficient manner; and I am proud to say they
have never yet stopped an hour for us.”</p>

<p>Sir H. Burrard, with the chivalrous courtesy which has so
often been repeated in the annals of the English army, did not
interfere with Sir A. Wellesley’s command during the battle,
but at its termination he declined to accede to the proposal
of the latter to undertake an energetic pursuit, which would
doubtless have ended in an unconditional surrender of the
French troops. Of Sir Arthur’s bitter disappointment,&mdash;of
the further complication caused by the arrival of yet another
General to supersede Sir H. Burrard&mdash;Sir Hew Dalrymple,&mdash;of
the singular Convention of Cintra, which while it certainly
succeeded in procuring the evacuation of Portugal by
the French, did so on terms which were very disproportionate
to the success of the English arms,&mdash;and of the
indignation in England which followed the news of this
marvellous treaty,&mdash;it is beyond the province of this work
to treat. The state of affairs in Portugal&mdash;the absence of
<span class="sidenote">Wellington
Supplementary
Despatches,
&amp;c., vol. vi.
p. 129.</span>
all harmony of plan or action, was such as to call from Sir
Arthur Wellesley the expression, “Considering the way in
which things are likely to be carried on here, I shall not
be sorry to go away.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span></p>

<p>The recall of Sir Hew Dalrymple, Sir H. Burrard, and
Sir A. Wellesley to England, on account of the Court of
Enquiry ordered to investigate the circumstances under
which the Convention had been agreed to, left the command
of the English forces in Portugal with Sir John Moore.
An army of 28,000 men was concentrated at Lisbon under
that General. The command of the Artillery, which had
been considerably reinforced, had been given to Colonel
Harding, who endorsed every complaint which had been
made by Colonel Robe, but who seems to have been somewhat
more of an optimist than that officer; for in one of
his letters, describing his field artillery, he wrote that “four
oxen and two horses bring along a gun famously.” On
his arrival at Lisbon, he found that he had to arrange for
the proper equipment not merely of his own batteries, but
also of the artillery of a force of 4000 Spaniards at Lisbon,
whom the Convention had set free, and who, when armed
and equipped, marched for Catalonia. Sir John Moore
decided on taking the field in October 1808, but being misinformed
as to the state of the roads, he decided on breaking
up his army, so as to march by different roads, and to unite
at Salamanca with another army under Sir David Baird,
which had landed at Corunna. The Artillery was ordered
to march through the Alemtejo and by Badajos to Talavera,
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Harding to
D.-A.-Gen.</span>
and was arranged by Colonel Harding as follows. He himself,
Lieut.-Colonel Wood, Major Viney, with the following companies,
Thornhill’s, Drummond’s, Wilmot’s, Raynsford’s,
Crawford’s, Carthew’s, and Skyring’s, went with the army;
the guns being four brigades of light 6-pounders, and one
of 9-pounders. He was unable to take a brigade for each
company, for lack of horses. Colonel Robe was left in command
at Lisbon, with Major Hartmann and three companies
of the King’s German Artillery, Captain Bredin’s company
of the Royal Artillery, and half a company of the same
under Captain Lawson. The guns to which these were
attached consisted of a 12-pounder brigade, three brigades
of light 6-pounders, a few howitzers, and the car brigade
of 3-pounders from Gibraltar, mentioned above. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
force of Artillery with Sir David Baird’s army, which
had landed at Corunna, was commanded by Colonel Sheldrake,
and consisted of four companies and a proportion
of drivers. The guns used by this force, and by the Horse
Artillery under Colonel George Cookson, which arrived&mdash;also
at Corunna&mdash;on the 8th November, 1808, were as follows:&mdash;One
9-pounder brigade and three brigades of light
6-pounders, which moved on to Betanjos: one 9-pounder
brigade, and one of light 6-pounders, which remained at
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Cookson to
D.-A.-Gen.
Corunna,
9 Nov.
1808.</span>
Corunna; and one light 6-pounder brigade, and a brigade of
mountain artillery, for service with the Cavalry, as soon as
horses and mules could be obtained.</p>

<p>Of all the difficulties encountered in the winter campaign
of 1808 by the Royal Artillery, the scarcity of horses was
the greatest. The table given in a former part of this
chapter shows that after the first gross omission in the case
of Colonel Robe’s force, the Ordnance Department endeavoured,
as far as numbers were concerned, to send an
adequate supply of horses to ensure that mobility without
which field artillery is a sham. But that the simplest
precautions as to quality and soundness were overlooked is
too evident from the monotonous protests of all the officers
who found themselves in a position of responsibility.
Colonel Harding, writing from Lisbon, reported that he had
obtained permission to sell the Artillery horses he had
received from England, as useless and worn out, and to
purchase those of the French army, which was then
embarking under the provisions of the Convention of Cintra.
Colonel Cookson had not reached the Downs ere he had to
report the appearance of glanders among the horses entrusted
to him; and Colonel Robe had to report the death,
immediately after landing, of 75 out of 300 horses&mdash;more
than half occasioned by the same complaint. The officer in
charge of the drivers attached to the Artillery under the
command of Colonel Sheldrake, reported that “all his horses
were in dreadful order when they embarked, that he had
lost many, and that he attributed it in a great measure to
the horses being a great many very old.” Mules were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
difficult to obtain&mdash;the horses of the country were few and
of small size; and in spite of the plaintive appeals from
successive officers that “it cost no more to the country to
keep a good horse than a bad one,” shipload of cripples
from England followed shipload, and nothing but superhuman
exertions on the part of all on the spot enabled the
Artillery to move at all. The desperate state of affairs may
be gathered from a report of Colonel Robe’s, in which he
described the means left to him for horsing the brigades in
his charge, after Colonel Harding’s force had left Lisbon
with Sir John Moore. With 52 field guns, liable to be
demanded at any moment by Colonel Harding, he had only
500 men; but this number was lavish compared with that
<span class="sidenote">Col. Robe to
D.-A.-Gen.
1 Nov.

of his horses. “The following,” he wrote, “is a state of
the horses left with me on the departure of the army for
Spain<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The sick of these are reported to be in a very bad condition;
and nearly the whole of them to be at present

<p>So great was the scarcity of horses, that when the Horse
Artillery landed at Corunna, the officers’ horses were taken
on repayment&mdash;without their consent, and they were left to
purchase any animals they could find in the country. That
Colonel Robe had good reason to fear a demand being made
on his small depôt may be seen from the following account
of the number of horses, which the state of the roads
between Lisbon and Spain had rendered absolutely necessary
<span class="sidenote">Official

for the brigades which had marched with Colonel Harding.
Every artillery carriage, of whatever description, had 6
horses; the long 6-pounder gun had 8, and the 12-pounder
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
had 10. Besides this, horses were required for the officers,
non-commissioned officers, and for park duties; and the
ammunition waggons, for conveyance of such as could not
be carried on the limbers, were drawn by a motley collection
of horses, mules, and oxen. Six days after this return was
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Robe to

prepared, Colonel Robe’s supply had decreased to 40, and the
demands from the front were such that he declared no less
than a reserve of 600 horses would be required to meet them.</p>

<p>There is a danger, in perusing the noble story of the
Peninsular War, lest all the reader’s admiration should be
given to the courage and endurance of the men, or the skill
of the leaders. But there were men who would infinitely
rather have endured bodily suffering, than the charge
which neglect or ignorance at home had thrust upon them.
To feel in all its terrible reality the starvation of equipment,
without which no adequate results can be expected either
from skill or courage;&mdash;to know that if that equipment is
not in some way forthcoming, the disgrace of failure or
consequent disaster will be transferred from those to whom
it is due, and will be visited on themselves;&mdash;and at the
same time to be certain that any responsibility which they
may assume is at their own peril, and can only be exercised
with a halter round their neck of possible disallowances,
reprimands, and suspicion,&mdash;all these produce in men a state
of mind, beside which danger or bodily hardship seems
almost repose. And it was in such a condition that many of
England’s best soldiers had to live during the war in Spain&mdash;enduring
more than has formed the theme of song and
story&mdash;and yet bearing it without sympathy, without
acknowledgment.</p>

<p>No one can thoroughly understand Sir John Moore’s
campaign in Spain without bearing in mind the boasting
and lying of the Spanish Generals, with whom it was intended
that he should co-operate, and the yet more extravagant
falsehoods of the Spanish Government. Deluded by these,
Sir John Moore, even after he had heard of the surrender of
Madrid to Napoleon, pressed on to Majorga in the hope of
effecting a junction with the Marquis Romana, and of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
receiving Sir David Baird’s reinforcement from Corunna.
With an English army of 25,000 men he pressed still farther
on to Sahagan, where for the first time he heard the whole
truth, and realised the strength of the French armies which
were being directed against him, under Napoleon himself.
With every Spanish General already beaten in detail, Madrid
in the hands of the enemy, and greatly superior forces
hurrying to meet him, he commenced a retreat which has
become famous,&mdash;the first step of which is thus described
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Harding to
D.-A.-Gen.
Majorga,
25/12/1808.</span>
by Colonel Harding:&mdash;“We fully expected to have engaged
the enemy on the 23rd, about five leagues from Sahagan;
the army was in full march at 8 o’clock on the night of
the 23rd, and hoped to have fallen in with them early in
the morning of the 24th. An intense hard frost, and the
whole of the roads one sheet of ice from the snow thawing
during the day, was much against the march of Artillery,
as we had not time to rough all the horses. The march
of the troops was stopped an hour after they marched off;
some of the troops, particularly Downman’s troop, were
out till 2 in the morning. The General received some
information immediately after the troops marched off,
which caused their sudden return. We now seem to be
pointing towards Corunna, and forming depôts that way.
Our movements have lately been so intricate and unexpected,
that if I had had time to write to you, I could give
you little information.... Lieutenant-Colonel Cookson
has the command of the three brigades on the right of the
line, Evelegh’s, Bean’s, and Wilmot’s. Lieutenant-Colonel
Wood has charge of those on the left of the line, Downman’s,
Drummond’s, and Carthew’s. Four reserve brigades
with the park are Raynsford’s (9-pounders), Crawford’s,
Brandreth’s, and Wall’s (light 6-pounders) brigades. The
park, stores, and ammunition are under Major Thornhill.
The depôts advanced are under Captain Skyring. There
is a brigade of mountain guns somewhere, which I hope
will not join us, but return to Corunna. We have lately
received 59 prize horses, which, although not good, are a
great help to us, from our great loss.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<p>English troops are apt to become demoralized during a
retreat; and in the retreat to Corunna, irregularity was
increased by the intense cold, suffering, and hardship which
the men had to endure. The conduct of the rear-guard and
of the Cavalry was, however, beyond all praise; and was due
in a great degree to the constant presence of Sir John
Moore himself, whose skill, firmness, and powers of persuasion
never shone more clearly than at this time. But,
even when irregularity was greatest, it vanished when an
engagement appeared probable: it was at such times as these,
that perfect discipline prevailed. The Artilleryman reads
with pleasure that while 2627 men strayed from the English
army during the retreat, not one belonged to his corps; and
<span class="sidenote">Cadell.</span>
that Sir John Moore himself was so struck by this fact and by
their general conduct, that he wrote, “The Artillery consists
of particularly well-behaved men.” These words are the
more gratifying as the strength of the Artillery was considerable&mdash;eleven
brigades of guns,&mdash;and the duties of the
men were very arduous.</p>

<p>Several affairs of small importance took place between the
two armies, but the English came in sight of Corunna without
any general engagement. The dismay which seized
every one on learning that the transports had not yet
arrived may be imagined; fortunately it was short-lived, as
they soon made their appearance.</p>

<p>The story of the Artillery at the end of the retreat, and
during the battle of Corunna, may be summarised from
Colonel Harding’s reports. On the 11th January the army
took up a position about five miles from Corunna; but on
the 14th, being unable, with their reduced numbers, sufficiently
to occupy this ground without danger of being outflanked,
they withdrew to a position about three miles
nearer the town, leaving their original ground to be occupied
by Soult, before the battle. On the 12th all the Artillery,
except the brigades required for outpost and rearguard
duties, was ordered by Sir John Moore to be embarked; and
at the same time a magazine containing 12,000 barrels of
powder, situated about four miles from Corunna, was blown
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
up with great skill, under the supervision of Colonel
Cookson. This was not done, however, until some 400
barrels had been carried for the use of the Artillery, along
dreadful roads, for a distance of four miles, on the shoulders
of the Artillerymen; while at the same time serviceable
arms were issued from the stores to all the troops, in
exchange for those which had become useless during the
retreat. A supply of ammunition at the rate of 70 rounds
per man was also given out. These measures had the
double effect of destroying valuable stores which must have
inevitably fallen into the hands of the enemy, and of giving
an advantage to the English army in the battle which
ensued, which was denied to their opponents, whose arms
and ammunition had suffered greatly during the harassing
marches of the preceding days.</p>

<p>All the Artillerymen, who could be spared from the
embarkation of guns and stores on the 14th and 15th, were
employed in the destruction of the guns and mortars on the
sea front of Corunna (which would otherwise have been used
against the English fleet, on the occupation of the town by
the French), and also of those mounted on a small island in
the bay. Upwards of 50 heavy guns and 20 mortars were
dismounted, spiked, and thrown over the precipice, and their
carriages and beds destroyed. In this the men were
assisted cheerfully by the inhabitants, although, as Napier
points out, they were aware that the English army would
ultimately embark, and that they would incur the enemy’s
anger for having taken part in any military operations.
This conduct, so inconsistent with the insufficient defence
made by the Spaniards as a nation, drew forth from the
historian a remark, which the events of 1873 have strangely
justified: “Of proverbially vivid imagination and quick resentments,
the Spaniards feel and act individually, rather
than nationally.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Official MS.
Return,

Colonel
Harding.</div>

<p>The Artillery of the outposts, on which the brunt of the
action of the 16th fell, was commanded by Major Viney,
and consisted of 145 officers and men of the Royal Artillery,
and 94 officers and men of the Royal Artillery Drivers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
The guns employed were seven light 6-pounders, one
5½-inch howitzer, and four Spanish 8-pounders.</p>

<p>The names of the officers serving under Major Viney’s
command were as follows: Captains Truscott, Wilmot,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
Godby, and Greatley; Lieutenants Sinclair and King; and
Assistant-Surgeons Price and Hutchison. The officers of
the Royal Artillery Drivers were Lieutenants Abercromby
and Read.</p>

<p>A slight affair of picquets took place on the 15th; but
even as late as noon on the 16th, Sir John Moore told
Colonel Harding that he did not think the enemy meant
to attack, and therefore he continued the embarkation.
Most of the horses and appointments belonging to Downman’s
and Evelegh’s troops of Horse Artillery had been lost
during the retreat; and their guns, and those of several of
the other brigades, had been placed on board ship; so that
many of the Artillerymen, who had been present during the
retreat, and were under fire on the 16th, were without
their guns on that day, and were employed in bringing up
ammunition for the army. The Artillery of the outposts,
although lightly armed, did good service; but the ground
was not calculated for the manœuvring of guns, either on
the side of the French or of the English.</p>

<p>On Monday the 16th, at 3 <small>P.M.</small>, Soult advanced with all
his army in three columns, his cavalry and artillery remaining
on the heights to cover his formations. Two divisions of
the English army, under General Hope and Sir David Baird,
occupied the most advanced ground on their side, with their
left to the Bay of Corunna; a third division, under General
Frazer, was posted on some heights to the right&mdash;more
retired&mdash;commanding the approaches to Corunna from the
<span class="sidenote">To D.-A.-G.
23 June,
1809.
N.B. Capt.
Gardiner
was Brigade-Major
to the R. A.</span>
Vigo Road. Captain Gardiner wrote: “The action became
general about 3 o’clock, and an uninterrupted fire of cannon
and musketry was kept up till one hour after dark. They
evidently pushed for our right, which was our weakest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
point, but the firmness of our line was in no way to be
shaken. At one time I feared they would outflank us from
their numbers; but this was prevented by the movements
of the reserve under General Paget. At a little after
6 o’clock Soult retired, leaving us masters of the field,
and in possession of a village he occupied in the morning.”
This village, Elvina, had been to the battle of Corunna
what Hougomont and La Haye Sainte were afterwards to
that of Waterloo. The battle, at various periods of the day,
raged fiercely round it. Here Sir David Baird received the
wound which compelled him to leave the field; and it was
when watching the attack by the English reserve on the
French troops in possession of this village late in the day,
that Sir John Moore received the wound which proved fatal.
Its retention by the English at the close of the day was
therefore a distinct proof of victory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Despatch
to Sir D.
Baird.</div>

<p>But it was not a victory, as General Hope well said,
which could be attended by any very brilliant consequences
to Great Britain. The utmost that could be hoped for was
the embarkation of the army without molestation. Thanks
to the defeat of the French, their want of ammunition, and
the friendly courage of the inhabitants of Corunna, the
whole army, with the exception of the rear-guard, was embarked
with perfect order during the night of the 16th.
The incessant rumble of wheels over the field denoted the
gathering of the wounded, and their conveyance in the artillery
carts and waggons to the beach. The guns which
had been engaged during the day were taken for embarkation
to a sandy bay, south-west of Corunna, but, as Colonel
Harding wrote, “The weather would not permit it: the
guns were spiked; the carriages destroyed; and the
whole thrown over a precipice into deep water.”</p>

<p>The rear-guard had been detailed by Sir John Moore
himself, to assist the Spaniards in manning the guns on
the land front of Corunna,&mdash;to keep possession of the small
island in the bay,&mdash;and to cover the embarkation of the
troops from the citadel. The Artillery attached to it was
commanded by Major Beevor, assisted by Major Thornhill,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
Captains Truscott, Beane, Brandreth, and Greatley, and
Lieutenants Maling, Wright, and Darby. There were 36
non-commissioned officers and 253 men. The whole of the
rear-guard was embarked, but with difficulty, on the evening
of the 18th and morning of the 19th. The voyage to
England was tempestuous in the extreme. Many officers
and men died on the passage; many others, including
Colonel Harding himself, only survived their hardships a
few months. The whole army landed in England at various
ports in such a state of destitution, that the whole nation
was shocked, and could not believe it possible that the story
of the final success was true. These skeleton regiments,
starved and half-clothed, had not the appearance of an
army fresh from victory; and for many years the skill
displayed in the retreat upon Corunna, and the subsequent
success, received little, if any, credit from the people.</p>

<p>So ended Sir John Moore’s campaign in Spain;&mdash;and with
it&mdash;his life. A type of the same individuality of which the
Duke of Wellington was the perfection,&mdash;in which a sense of
duty rises above every other feeling,&mdash;he yet possessed
charms of character, denied to his great comrade, which
won for him the love, as well as the confidence, of his
troops. A disciplinarian, indeed, he was&mdash;what leader can
be great who is not?&mdash;but, with all his strictness, there was
something so winning in his disposition, that even after a
lapse of fifty years, the writer of these pages has seen tears
in the eyes of a man who had served under him, at the mere
mention of his name.</p>

<p>The many letters from the various officers, whose correspondence
with the Ordnance is extant, tell in simple
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Harding to
D. A. Gen.</span>
words the worth of the leader who fell at Corunna. “You
have heard,” writes one, “of our terrible loss: we could
<span class="sidenote">Captain
(afterwards
Sir
R.) Gardiner
to
D. A. Gen.</span>
not believe he was dead.” Another writes: “General
Hope’s despatches will acquaint you with our affecting
loss. You will imagine how severely I felt it. I saw him
after he received the wound, but he was talking with such
firmness, that I did not apprehend the danger he was in.”
General Hope’s words cannot be too frequently read. “The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
<span class="sidenote">Despatch
to Sir D.
Baird,
18 Jan.
1809.</span>
fall of Sir John Moore has deprived me of a valuable
friend, to whom long experience of his worth had sincerely
attached me. But it is chiefly on public grounds that
I must lament the blow. It will be the consolation of
every one who loved or respected his manly character,
that after conducting the army through an arduous retreat
with consummate firmness, he has terminated a career
of distinguished honour by a death that has given the
enemy additional reason to respect the name of a British
soldier. Like the immortal Wolfe, he is snatched from
his country at an early period of a life spent in her
service: like Wolfe, his last moments were gilded by the
prospect of success, and cheered by the acclamation of
victory: like Wolfe, also, his memory will for ever
remain sacred in that country which he sincerely loved,
and which he had so faithfully served.”</p>

<p>There is a pathos about these words, which is not surpassed
even in the lines which have given an eternal place
in English verse to the battle which has just been described.
But all the regret of friends, all the eloquence of admirers,
all the hymns of poets, fade into nothing beside the simple
words of the dying chief,&mdash;who uttered with his last breath
no appeals for praise, no boastings of difficulties overcome,
no chidings against those who had disappointed or deceived
him, but the quiet, confident expression of a soldier whose
duty is done: “I hope that my country will do me justice.”</p>

<p>The following return shows the strength of the Royal
Artillery left in Portugal, after the evacuation of Spain by
Sir John Moore’s army. It also shows the number who had
returned at various times from the Peninsula, prior to 27th
February, 1809, having proceeded thither with the various

<span class="medium smcap">Walcheren.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">An</span> expedition has now to be described, to whose conception
and partial execution justice has not been done
by historians. Remembered, if at all, for its miserable termination,
it is not unfrequently classed among the military
operations which an Englishman had better forget. And
yet there was a strategic value in the idea, which was
proved even by its incomplete realisation; and there was a
determination, and an uncomplaining suffering among the
English troops, worthy of note in military story, which
have been ill repaid by the nameless graves which crowd the
island of Walcheren, and by the national forgetfulness of the
expedition.</p>

<p>To an Artilleryman the Walcheren Expedition has an interest
which well repays him for turning his eyes and
thoughts from the Peninsula to this strange island in the
Northern Sea. Here no less than seventeen troops and companies
of his Corps were present; and so important was
their duty considered, that the Master-General, Lord Chatham,
who was also Commander-in-Chief of the forces employed,
requested the Deputy-Adjutant-General, Brigadier
Macleod, himself to accompany the army in command of
the Artillery. And on this island, so baneful to our troops,
and yet so beautiful, a singular historical question connected
with the Regiment was settled, which will receive detailed
notice in this chapter.</p>

<p>Forming the right bank of the West Scheldt at its mouth,
the islands of South Beveland and Walcheren, now united by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
a railway embankment, present to the traveller the most
singular appearance. Rich and fertile beyond measure, they
are yet only saved from submersion by the sea by means of
costly dykes, kept efficient by incessant labour. In most
places the island of Walcheren, especially, is many feet below
the level of the sea; and even its highest points, the towns
of Middleburg and Flushing, have frequently suffered great
injury from the inroads of the ocean. One such inundation
had occurred in 1808, and tended to make the autumn of
1809 exceptionally unhealthy. Dykes now not merely
surround the island itself, but also the individual villages
and farmhouses on its surface, giving a curious fortified
appearance to the whole.</p>

<p>Flushing and Antwerp, in the hands of Napoleon, strongly
fortified, and offering protection and anchorage to his fleets,
were a strong and perpetual menace to England, and gave
an appearance of probability to his threats of invasion, both
in the eyes of the English people and their Government.
One of the strongest arguments against the Walcheren
Expedition has always been that it was a dissipation of
England’s military resources, which, if concentrated on the
Peninsular campaign, would have produced infinitely greater
results. But it is easy to argue thus with the wisdom which
follows the fact. The danger which was involved in the
fortifications of Antwerp and Flushing was very present to
the English people; and immunity in that respect seemed
then more desirable than victory at a distance, even
although that victory might, in the end, have been a more
serious blow at Napoleon’s power. And the importance of
Flushing, armed as it was, may be now better realised by
imagining it in the hands of a powerful Continental dynasty,&mdash;not
dismantled and disarmed, as it has been since the
siege to be treated of in this chapter,&mdash;but with batteries
sufficiently strong to protect the anchorage in front, and
with a fleet riding there, within a few hours of the English
coast. Were such a thing ever to occur again&mdash;and it is by
no means impossible&mdash;Englishmen would perhaps confess
that there was more wisdom in the Expedition of 1809,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
which rendered Flushing harmless, than has generally been
allowed.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>Much of the unpopularity attending it, and all the incompleteness
of execution, were due to a want of harmony
between the naval and military commanders, which has never
yet been satisfactorily explained, but which undoubtedly
was the main cause of the first part of the scheme&mdash;the capture
of Flushing&mdash;being the only part that was executed.
Lord Chatham would appear to have been much to blame in
the matter; but there has been a mystery connected with it
all, which cannot be cleared up. Of that nobleman’s military
incapacity there is, however, no doubt; nor is the reader
surprised to find that his name disappeared, soon after this
Expedition, from the list of the Masters-General of the
Ordnance.</p>

<p>The troop of Horse Artillery which accompanied the force
was that commanded by Captain A. Macdonald, and is now
D Battery, A Brigade. The sixteen companies will be found
enumerated in the various tables of the battalions. General
Macleod took Captain&mdash;afterwards Sir Robert&mdash;Gardiner as
his Brigade-Major; and it is from the private diaries of
these officers that the main Regimental incidents connected
<span class="sidenote">Sir J. T.
Jones’s
‘Sieges.’</span>
with this Expedition have been obtained. Captain Drummond
was the General’s Aide-de-camp. The field officers
who accompanied the Artillery were Colonel Terrot, Lieut.-Colonels
Dixon, Franklin, Cookson, and Wood, and Majors
Griffiths, Dixon, and Waller. The immense battering train
included 70 guns and 74 mortars; and we learn that not
merely was a large supply of Congreve’s rockets taken for
<span class="sidenote">A.-A.-Gen.
to Colonel
Neville,
18 July,
1809.</span>
employment as siege weapons, but also that every man in
the Regiment who had been trained to the use of rockets
was ordered to embark with the army.</p>

<p>The name of nearly every Artillery officer with the Expedition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
will appear in the course of the narrative. In the
meantime the following numerical return of the force under
General Macleod’s command will be found worthy of perusal.
(<i>See opposite page.</i>)</p>

<p>The Second Division of the army, which General Macleod
accompanied, sailed from the Downs on Saturday, the 29th
July, 1809, and anchored the same evening in the Stein
Diep. On the following day they weighed anchor, and
moved into the Room Pot, where they found the First
Division, and where orders were at once given for the troops
to land in light marching order. At 4 <small>P.M.</small> the first six
battalions landed, without opposition, at the Bree Zand, and
during the night the remainder of the troops, under the command
of Sir Eyre Coote, continued to disembark, with the
several brigades of Artillery attached to them,&mdash;the last named
being under the command of Colonel Terrot. The following
detail shows the Artillery attached to this part of the army<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>There was also a Heavy Brigade under Captain S. Adye.</p>

<p>About 3 <small>P.M.</small> the reserve, under Sir John Hope, proceeded
to South Beveland (immediately adjoining Walcheren), accompanied
by Captain Wilmot’s Light 6-pounder Brigade.</p>

<p>On Monday, the 31st July, Ter Veer, a village at the opposite
end of the island of Walcheren from Flushing, was invested,
two guns of Captain Macdonald’s troop and two 8-inch
mortars having been landed to assist; and it surrendered
the following day. Until the fall of Flushing, Ter Veer was
employed as a landing-place and depôt for ordnance stores,&mdash;the
Balaclava of the Walcheren Expedition. The army then
advanced across the island, and proceeded to invest Flushing.
During the siege, frequent reinforcements of the French
garrison took place, their troops being transported by sea
from Cadsand, and the weather being such as to render it very
difficult for the English fleet to intercept them. The defence
made by the French was very gallant, although the wretched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
inhabitants were the main sufferers during the bombardment.
By Napoleon’s positive order, and notwithstanding the remonstrances
of the French Commandant, one of the dykes
near Flushing was partly cut, and the sea poured into the
English trenches to a considerable extent, increasing the
discomfort and difficulties which the heavy and almost incessant
rains had already produced.</p>

in the walls of many of the houses,&mdash;handing down from one
generation to another the traditions of the siege.</p>

<p>The chief labour and hardship, however, to the English
troops preceded the opening of the batteries. It was during
their construction that the energies of officers and men
were most severely tried. The roads between Ter Veer and
the trenches became almost impassable with constant traffic
and rain; the landing of the guns and stores was attended
with great difficulty; it was impossible to procure cattle in
sufficient quantities for purposes of draught; and many of
the horses intended for the later operations had to be landed
at Walcheren to draw the stores from Ter Veer. As for the
trenches themselves, a few extracts from Sir R. Gardiner’s
diary will enable the reader to realise the conditions under
which the Artillerymen worked<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“August 10th. Ascertained, by the saltness of the water,
that the dyke had been cut.... The water making
great progress in the communication from the right to
West Zouberg. The cross-roads very deep and bad; great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
difficulty in drawing the guns from the park to the several
batteries.</p>

<p>“August 11th. A violent thunder-storm and incessant
rains during the night precluded all work the greatest
part of it. The water rose in the gun-battery on the left
about six inches.</p>

<p>“August 12. The roads much worse, and the water
rose very high in the trenches. The water-gauge showed
the rising of the water to be 4 inches. The magazine
of No. 1 Battery on the right was filled with water
during the night from the heavy rains, and it was feared
would not be ready to receive the ammunition. <i>The
exertions of the men, however, overcame every obstacle.</i>”</p>

<p>Three companies, commanded by Captains Drummond,
Campbell, and Fyers, had landed at Ter Veer on the
8th August, and proved of great service in the batteries
at Oust Zouberg; but the Artillery before Flushing had
been weakened the previous day by the removal of the
detachments of Captains Buckner’s and Brome’s companies,
with Captains Adye and Light, under the command of
Colonel Cookson, to join the force in South Beveland, in
consequence of a letter received from Sir John Hope.
There was considerable anxiety in South Beveland. The
forts had, certainly, been occupied by the English; and
Captain Wilmot had succeeded in unspiking and rendering
serviceable almost all the guns which they found; but there
were many reasons for disquiet. Provisions were not so
easily obtained as had been expected in such a country;
the inhabitants, without exhibiting actual hostility, were
decidedly cool and unfriendly; rumours were spread, which
magnified every hour, announcing large reinforcements, not
merely to Antwerp, but to every Dutch garrison, and describing
swarms of French troops being pushed forward in
waggons and boats to form a large army at Bergen-op-Zoom,
or some such place, with a view to assuming the
offensive; the drains made on their resources by the army
in Walcheren alarmed the military chiefs; and the disagreement
between the Admiral and Lord Chatham as to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
method of conducting future operations had already ceased
to be secret. It does not, therefore, surprise the reader to
find that when, after the fall of Flushing, all the troops
and horses which had been originally intended for the
second operation, as the design on Antwerp was termed,
were about to return to South Beveland, a decided
hesitation manifested itself among the authorities, which
ended in a suspense from further action. Before the end of
August, the whole of the Horse Artillery, Cavalry, and all the
horses of the battering train had returned to England;&mdash;Captains
Wilmot’s, Buckner’s, and Brome’s companies were
ordered to follow, after dismantling the forts in South
Beveland;&mdash;on the 2nd September, Lord Chatham’s head-quarters
were moved to Middleburg, in Walcheren;&mdash;on the
3rd, the embarkation of much of the ordnance, stores, &amp;c.,
for England commenced;&mdash;on the 10th, Lord Chatham
announced that he had received the King’s commands to
return home; and on the 14th, accompanied by his staff,
including General Macleod, he sailed from Flushing.</p>

<p>The much-vaunted Expedition was therefore at an end;
and with the exception of the garrison of Walcheren, the
army returned home by instalments. But in the successful
part of the campaign,&mdash;the capture of Flushing, there is more
than a crumb of comfort for the Artilleryman who is in
search of incidents creditable to his corps. The words
penned after the siege by Lord Chatham, who was observant,
although incapable, are worthy of a high place
in the Regimental records. “It is <i>impossible</i>,” he wrote,
<span class="sidenote">Lord
Chatham’s
Despatch
announcing
the surrender
of
Flushing.</span>
“for me to do sufficient justice to the distinguished conduct
of the officers and men of the Royal Artillery, under
the able direction and animating example of Brigadier-General
Macleod.” And in a letter presently to be
quoted, the reader will see that in the duller work of dismantling
the works, under circumstances of great difficulty
and sickness, the men of the Royal Artillery earned noble
words of commendation.</p>

<p>Walcheren has been remembered for the sickness which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
scourged the English army in 1809, when it has been forgotten
as to everything else;&mdash;and the sickness certainly was
fearful; although perhaps due more to exposure, injudicious
diet, and inefficient hospital arrangements, than to any local
influences, such as were conceived by superstition and fear.
The former, it is known, <i>did</i> exist; and their results have
been seen in later days, during the first winter of the war
in the Crimea, much as they were in Walcheren. But the
latter,&mdash;the mysterious local fevers, which were believed to
be indigenous to this island,&mdash;seem to have marvellously disappeared,
or to be innocuous, as far as the healthy, contented,
and long-lived inhabitants of its beautiful villages are concerned.
Be that, however, as it may; the sickness among the
English troops in 1809 was very great. On the 30th August
there were 5000 sick; on the 3rd September the number
increased to 5745; on the 5th September it rose to 8000;
and on the 8th it was no less than 10,948, with fresh cases
occurring every hour. The sickness in the Artillery may be
gathered from a return which is extant. On the 27th September
there had been left in Walcheren a total strength
of 1089 officers and men belonging to the Royal Artillery
and Royal Artillery Driver Corps. Before the 16th October,&mdash;in
less than three weeks,&mdash;255 had been sent sick
to England, 396 were sick at Walcheren, and 109 were in
their graves. From a return of the officers who were invalided
to England, we find the names of many not yet
mentioned, including Captains Oliver, Monro, Parker,
Wallace, Greene, and Scott; and Lieutenants J. Evans,
Parker, Dalton, Pringle, Grant, Chapman, and Drawbridge.
The names of others, who remained to the date of the
evacuation of the island, will be mentioned presently.</p>

<p>After Lord Chatham’s departure, it was intended at first
to strengthen the island for defence in the event of a French
attack. Napoleon being, however, as he said, perfectly
satisfied that the English should die in Zealand without
any assistance from him, and the continued sickness appalling
the authorities, it was decided to dismantle the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
newly-armed batteries with a view to the evacuation of
the place. This was done under the control and supervision
of Major William Dixon, R.A., assisted by the remnants
of the twelve companies, left as part of the garrison of the
island. On his arrival in Woolwich, with these companies,
he made a report to the Deputy Adjutant-General, which
cannot fail to be interesting. “It would be of no use now,
<span class="sidenote">Major
Dixon to
D.-A.-Gen.,
3 Jan.
1810.</span>
sir,” he wrote, “to enter into a detailed account of the
state of defence in which Walcheren was placed at the
moment the order came to withdraw; but, in justice
to the officers and men I had the good fortune to command,
you will permit me to state that, up to the 15th
November, every possible exertion was made to withstand
an attack in the field, or a siege in the fortified places.
All the Dutch mortars and many of the guns were exchanged
for English; the extra foreign ammunition sent off
to England; Flushing, Veer, and Rammekens completed;
the coast strengthened by batteries mounted with heavy
ordnance; the field brigades distributed to the different
corps of the army; and depôts of ammunition established
throughout. These labours were effected without any
assistance from the troops of the Line, and under circumstances
peculiarly trying;&mdash;the companies diminished
by sickness to one-third of their original strength, and
even then jaded and worn by an oppression and feeling
from climate, which I cannot describe, but which actually
did not amount to disease. Yet, sir, notwithstanding
this, I am happy to say they performed every part of their
duty without a murmur, and obeyed every order with
zeal and alacrity.</p>

<p>“It will be plain to you, sir, that as we had risen to this
state of defence, so in proportion were our labours increased
when we came to dismantle. All that was done
had to be undone; and every article of guns, ammunition,
and stores throughout the island, to be embarked in the
least possible time. The same diligence was continued,
and within the given period not a trace remained in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
works of the ordnance with which they had been defended....
Without meaning to take at all from the
general report of the good conduct of the officers and men
employed in the island of Walcheren, but as you are aware
that, from various causes, there are degrees even in excellence
itself, I hope I shall not be considered as acting
inconsistently when I recommend the following officers
as more particularly deserving your approbation. To
Captains Maitland and Light I am greatly indebted for
their activity and zeal in completing the defences of
Walcheren. To Captain Adye I owe everything for the
assistance he gave in dismantling the works, and embarking
the guns, ammunition, and stores; and to his name,
which, in every respect, deservedly stands first, I beg
leave to add those of Captains Rawlinson, Maitland, and
Macartney, in the same undertaking. The whole of the
subalterns went through every part of the duties imposed
on them with zeal and goodwill, even in serving on board
the <i>shutes</i> with parties of gunners to load and unload
these vessels. I could place no reliance on the Dutch who
navigated them, but was thus compelled to ensure their
services by guarding against their escape. The navy, I
presume, could not (for they certainly <i>would</i> not) grant us
any assistance. Nautical skill we were not supposed to
possess, but necessity, at length, helped us to find it. I
shall conclude, sir, by recommending to your favour
Lieutenant Anderson, the acting Adjutant, whose zeal
and activity neither sickness nor fatigue could arrest, and
I cannot hesitate in pronouncing him one of the finest
young men I ever met in my life.”</p>

<p>The amount of ordnance and stores captured in the
islands of South Beveland and Walcheren, and either sent
to England or destroyed, was very considerable. Summarised,
according to date of capture, the following is a
list of the guns and mortars which were taken.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>

<p>There were, in addition to the ordnance mentioned above,
very large supplies of ammunition and stores of every
description, of which the islands were denuded on their
evacuation by the English.</p>

<p>The embarkation of the troops from Walcheren was conducted
under circumstances of great difficulty. The weather
was unfavourable, and for many days after the men were
on board, the wind was so adverse as to prevent the ships
from sailing. A rear-guard had been left on shore to guard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
against any attack from the enemy, whose vessels had been
accumulating for some weeks in the neighbourhood; and
the troops on board the English ships were held in readiness
for immediate disembarkation, should the expected attack
take place. Some reinforcements which reached the island
from England during the embarkation, including two companies
of Artillery under Lieut.-Colonel Gold and Major
Carncross, were not required to land, but their arrival had a
moral effect in ensuring a peaceable evacuation of the place.
From Colonel Gold, who landed for a few hours, a graphic
description of the state of Walcheren was forwarded to
General Macleod in Woolwich. Major Dixon had previously
boasted of the thoroughness of his measures in destroying
<span class="sidenote">Major
Dixon to
D.-A.-Gen.,
4 Dec.
1809.</span>
the fortifications. “I am most happy,” he wrote, “to say
that not an article in point of honour or value will be
found in the island when the enemy again takes possession:
never was there a clearer sweep (I mean in a military
point of view); and I am satisfied that he will not for years
be enabled to use the Bason for the purposes of the navy.
All the parapets are also thrown down, and not a vestige
is to be seen of gun, ammunition, or store throughout the
island.” This picture was confirmed and completed by
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Gold to
D.-A.-Gen.,
10 Dec.
1809.</span>
Colonel Gold, who wrote as follows: “I arrived just in time
to witness the destruction of the Arsenal, which is completely
effected; the entrance to the Bason, in which the
French navy were sheltered last winter, is entirely choked
up by blowing up the pieces of the flood-gates. Never
was a scene of greater <i>public mischief</i>. On putting foot on
shore I found Macartney in the midst of a wreck of carriages,
and, at Flushing, Pilkington and Dixon surrounded
by their own conflagrations; while Middleburg presented
the most pacific appearance, and even at a church in
Flushing, immediately opposite to the scene of destruction,
divine service going on as if nothing unusual had occurred....
I have been across the island to-day, and
although, from the many good descriptions I had heard,
I was fully prepared, I could not have conceived any
country so intolerably bad for military operations; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
that you (General Macleod) made your batteries and got
your guns into them is surprising.”</p>

<p>From these extracts, it will be seen that the first object
of this much-abused Expedition was completely effected, and
Walcheren rendered innocuous, as a means of menacing
England. That this was mainly owing to the energy and
perseverance of the troops has, it is hoped, also been made
apparent. Alas! that the story of this Expedition, as of so
many others from England, would be incomplete without the
mention of failures in the supply departments of the army.
Three months after the fall of Flushing, the troops were
<span class="sidenote">Dated
Flushing,
14 Nov.
1809.</span>
still suffering from want of necessary comforts. “It will
be doing us a very great favour,” wrote Major Dixon, “if
you can by any means expedite the arrival of the <i>bedding</i>.
It is now miserably cold, and I am convinced that much
of our indisposition arises from the want of necessary accommodation
and comfort. By a letter from the Honourable
Board (two packets ago) I expected bedding for the
whole of the Ordnance Department, but nothing of the
kind has yet appeared.” From complaints like these the
reader cannot fail to suspect that much of the exaggerated
abuse of the climate of Walcheren was employed to shield
those departments, whose members, in this as in other wars,
have evinced a belief that the army exists for them, not they
for the army.</p>

<p>It only remains to tell the singular story, whose conclusion
has affected the regimental privileges of the Royal Artillery
from the fall of Flushing to this day. Mention has been
made several times in this work of a custom, which placed
the bells of a captured city, or an equivalent, at the disposal
of the commanding officer of the Artillery of the besieging
force. The privilege&mdash;as the reader will remember&mdash;had
been exercised so recently as at the siege of Copenhagen.
After the surrender of Flushing, General Macleod preferred
<span class="sidenote">Lieut.-Col.
Mosheim
to Lieut.-Colonel
Wood, 4/9/1809.</span>
the usual claim. The Mayor and Corporation replied through
the Commandant that they acknowledged with due respect
a right established by custom immemorial that the bells
belonged to the commanding officer of the Royal Artillery,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
if he thought proper to enforce his claim, but that they were
persuaded he would grant consideration to their already
sufficiently distressed condition, and not deprive the unfortunate
town of its bells, which they would be as incapable
of replacing, as they felt unable to tender any compensation
for them. On the following day, General Macleod
replied that, in consideration of the destruction brought
upon the town of Flushing by the system of defence which
the French General had thought proper to adopt, he had no
wish to add to the misery of the inhabitants by seizing the
bells, or by demanding a strict compensation to the full
amount of their value. In consenting, however, to sacrifice
to a great extent his own rights and pretensions, he could
not, he said, in any degree compromise those of the Corps.
He must, therefore, demand a modified sum in order specifically
to mark the transaction, and to enable him at the
same time to contribute to the comforts of the officers
and men who had partaken in the artillery duties of the
siege.</p>

<p>Valuing the bells at 2000<i>l.</i>, General Macleod expressed
his readiness to accept 500<i>l.</i> This offer was communicated
<span class="sidenote">M. Becker
to Lieut.-Colonel
Mosheim,
6 Sept,

by the French commandant to the Mayor of Flushing, but
was received with indignation:<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> “On nous a rapporté,”
wrote the Mayor, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“que Messieurs les officiers de l’Artillerie

Cette ville, et ces habitans, disons-nous, seroient-ils,
après avoir passé par tous ces malheurs, réduits à cette
extrémité de voir laisser enlevé ses cloches, faute de moyen

fermement résolus de lui emporter nos plaintes, en cas
que Messieurs les Officiers de l’Artillerie persistent dans

Britannique n’y fasse droit. Vous-même, Monsieur, qui
connaissez la situation de Flussingen, qui savez qu’une

vous adresser un double de notre lettre, vous priant
de l’adresser à son Excellence <i>My Lord</i> Chatham, et
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
d’appuyer auprès de son Excellence nos réclamations
raisonnables.”</span></p>

<p>This appeal was answered by General Macleod to the
effect that he could not, under any consideration, relinquish
the rights of his Corps: that he persisted in his claim,
which had received the perfect approbation of Lord Chatham;
but that, in consideration of the representations made by the
magistrates, he again renounced the idea of deriving emolument
to himself at the expense of the distresses of the inhabitants,
but would persist in the right of his Corps, unless
the magistrates should consent to pay the still further
reduced sum of one hundred guineas in establishment of
the right;&mdash;“to be disposed of in charity to the soldiers’
wives and widows of the Royal Artillery, as may be
thought proper hereafter.”</p>

<p>As General Macleod was on the eve of leaving Walcheren
for England, he transferred the correspondence to Colonel
Terrot, with the intimation that he himself would have no
objection to an appeal to the English Legislature, should
<span class="sidenote">Dated
Middleburg,
9 Sept.
1809.</span>
the magistrates of Flushing insist on it; but “in that case,”
he wrote, “it is to be understood that the appeal is for the
<i>whole</i> of the bells, or for the full amount of their value.
The appeal leaves no room for generosity on either side.”</p>

<p>The magistrates were obstinate, and the appeal was forwarded
to England. On the 12th November intimation was
sent to Major Dixon, in Walcheren, now in command of the
Artillery, that the decision was unfavourable to the claims
<span class="sidenote">Dated
Doctors’
Commons,
26 October,
1809.</span>
of the Corps. The following extract from the decision, addressed
by Sir Charles Robinson to the Earl of Liverpool,
explains the grounds on which it was based. “With respect
to the bells of the church, the demands of the
Artillery are, I conceive, altogether unsustainable. It
is apparently not supported on the part of the Prize Commissioners,
since they do not advert to this claim in their
letter of the 4th of October. Anciently, there prevailed
a law of pillage, which assigned to different corps and to
different individuals a privileged claim to particular articles.
Whether this was a privilege of the Artillery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
under the ancient custom of England, as described in the
Petition, I am not informed; but in the modern usage of
respecting property and public edifices, and more particularly
those set apart for divine worship, such a demand
cannot, I conceive, be sustained. What the custom may
be,&mdash;whether deserving of any compensation in the division
of what is properly <i>prize</i>, or from any other quarter,&mdash;may
be a subject of consideration according to circumstances.
But I am of opinion that the demand ought not to be
enforced against the town.”</p>

<p>From subsequent correspondence which is extant, and
which passed between General Macleod and Sir Anthony
Farrington, it is evident that the former felt much regret
that an old Regimental privilege should have disappeared
during operations in which he had occupied so prominent a
place; but the reader will admit that no one could have conducted
the cause of the Corps in a more unselfish, chivalrous,
and yet resolute manner.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>N.B.&mdash;The comments of an officer of the sister corps, on the conduct of
the Artillery at the siege of Flushing, were very favourable. Two extracts
from Sir J. Jones’s work may be given.</p>

<p>“The guns of the batteries on the right of the attack were more particularly
directed to enfilade and take <i>en écharpe</i> the rampart of the
western sea-line, in order to silence the fire of its artillery on the fleet,
now preparing to force the passage of the Scheldt. This they accomplished
very effectually, by disabling or very severely wounding many
of the traversing platforms and their carriages, and much injuring the
guns themselves.”</p>

<p>Again:</p>

<p>“Discharges of carcasses and shells from the mortar batteries, with
powerful flights of rockets intermixed, were kept up throughout the
night on the devoted town, and frequently large portions of it burned
with fury.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jones’s</span> ‘Sieges,’ vol. ii. pp. 269-271.</p></blockquote>

and Talavera.</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>“The deliverance of the Peninsula was never due to the foresight and
perseverance of the English ministers, but to the firmness and skill of the
British Generals, and to the courage of troops whom no dangers could
daunt and no hardships dishearten, while they remedied the eternal errors
of the Cabinet.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Napier.</span></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">In</span> resuming the story of the Peninsular War, it will be seen
that the narrative has to go back to an earlier date than
that of the expedition described in the last chapter,&mdash;Sir
Arthur Wellesley having returned from England to Lisbon, to
take command of the army, so early as the 22nd April, 1809.
But it has been thought better to clear the ground, so to
speak, of the Walcheren Expedition, and thus to enable the
reader to follow uninterruptedly the story of the operations,
which terminated in the glorious victory of Talavera, and the
subsequent withdrawal of the English troops from Spain to
Portugal.</p>

<p>The British Government still resolved that the English
army in Spain should be merely an auxiliary one, and remained
still undeceived as to the real state of the Spanish
forces. Perhaps it was as well, therefore, that the army
entrusted to Sir Arthur Wellesley was not a larger one; for
the difficulty he encountered in obtaining provisions and
transport from the Spaniards would have been insurmountable,
had the forces under his command been more numerous.
<span class="sidenote">Merida,
25 Aug.
1809.</span>
“I do not think,” wrote Sir Arthur to Lord Castlereagh,
Cthat matters would have been much better if you had sent
your large expedition to Spain instead of to the Scheldt.
You could not have equipped it in Galicia, or anywhere in
the north of Spain. If we had had 60,000 men instead of
20,000, in all probability we should not have got to Talavera
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
to fight the battle, for want of means and provisions.
But if we had got to Talavera, we could not have gone
farther, and the armies would probably have separated for
want of means of subsistence, probably without a battle,
but certainly afterwards.” The campaign of 1809, from beginning
to end, was marked by obstinacy on the part of Spanish
Generals, and faithlessness on the part of the Spanish
Government; by inadequate supplies of money from England,
and by difficulties with the Portuguese troops, not the less
annoying because they were often petty; as well as by hardships
which tried the discipline of the English troops quite
as much as the retreat to Corunna, and which drew from
<span class="sidenote">To Lord
Castlereagh,

Abrantes,

1809.</span>
Sir Arthur Wellesley the bitter words: “We are an excellent
army on parade, an excellent one to fight; but we are
worse than an enemy in a country; and, take my word for
it, that either defeat or success would dissolve us.” The
success which he almost dreaded came: the 27th and 28th
July witnessed as gallant an exhibition of English courage
as has ever been seen; but in a few days Sir Arthur wrote:
“A starving army is actually worse than none. The soldiers
<span class="sidenote">To Marquis
Wellesley,
dated
Deleytosa,

lose their discipline and spirit; they plunder even in presence
of their officers. The officers are discontented, and
are almost as bad as the men; and, with an army which
a fortnight ago beat double their numbers, I should now
hesitate to meet a French corps of half their strength.”
The administration which has so often marked our campaigns
with passages like this, cannot be too distinctly held
up to view as a perpetual warning. No troops, as Sir Arthur
wrote, can serve to any good purpose unless they are regularly
fed; and yet it is in this very point&mdash;the question of
supply&mdash;that our military history abounds with failures.</p>

<p>The army which had landed in England from Corunna
was speedily organized, and sent back to Portugal. Sir J.
Cradock commanded the troops at Lisbon, some 14,000 in
number; Marshal Beresford had been appointed to the
command of the Portuguese forces, and was assisted in his
task of organizing them by several British officers. All
arrangements were made for taking the field; and this was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
done immediately on the arrival of Sir Arthur Wellesley,
who was appointed Marshal-General of the united armies.
Colonel Kobe had remained in command of the Artillery in
Portugal during the interval between Corunna and Sir
Arthur’s arrival; but he was now superseded by Brigadier-General&mdash;afterwards
Sir E.&mdash;Howorth.  The number of
troops and companies in the Peninsula in 1809 was only
seven. There were, in addition, five at Gibraltar, five in
Italy, and three in Malta.</p>

<p>The Artillery officers first appointed for duty with Marshal
Beresford were Captain&mdash;afterwards Sir J.&mdash;May and
Captain Elliot, of the Royal Artillery, and also Captain
Arentschild, of the King’s German Artillery. Lieutenant
Charles was attached to the Portuguese force raised by Sir
Robert Wilson; and Captain P. Campbell and Lieutenant
Wills were employed with the Spanish troops at Seville and
Cadiz respectively.</p>

<p>General Howorth, on his arrival in Lisbon in the beginning
of April, arranged, with Colonel Robe’s assistance, the
equipment of five brigades of guns, to take the field with
the army, viz., one brigade of heavy 6-pounders, three of
light 6-pounders, and one of 3-pounders. These were all he
could equip; and, notwithstanding the opportune arrival,
from Ireland, of 170 drivers and 298 excellent horses, he yet
complained of the want of mobility from which they suffered,
mixed as they were with the horses of the country, mules,
and oxen. However, like Colonel Harding, he took a cheerful
view of matters, and pronounced the mules to be very fine
<span class="sidenote">To D.-A.-G.
Lisbon,

animals, and “the oxen, though slow, a steady, good
draught.” The development of the Field Artillery during
the Peninsular War, from the wretched batteries employed
at its commencement to those which attracted such admiration
at its close, will appear in the course of this work.
Suffice it, at present, to remind the Artilleryman, by way
of contrast, while the picture of the batteries of 1809 is
yet fresh in his recollection, that before the conclusion of
the Peninsular War, it was admitted by the artillerymen of
the country with which England was engaged in hostilities,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
<span class="sidenote">‘Le passé
et l’avenir
de l’Artillerie,’
tom. v.
p. 64.</span>
that “the English <i>matériel</i> might have been taken as a
model by any nation in Europe;”&mdash;that, shortly before
Waterloo, Marshal Marmont remarked that the equipment of
the English Field Artillery was in every respect very superior
to anything he had ever seen; and that the French
Committee appointed in 1818 to compare the Artillery of
<span class="sidenote">Hime.</span>
the various countries represented in the review held that
year in Paris, expressed unqualified delight with that of
England.</p>

<p>On Sir Arthur Wellesley’s arrival in Lisbon, he found that
Soult was in possession of Oporto, and Victor in Estremadura.
He promptly resolved to attack them in detail; and,
making Lisbon the base of his operations, he requested the
Spanish General, Cuesta, to watch Victor’s movements, while
he himself should march to the north against Soult. The
moral effect of driving the French out of Portugal would,
he felt, be very great&mdash;all the more so as his arrival had
produced a sudden hopefulness among the Portuguese, which
it was desirable not to disappoint.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on the 1st May, he moved his head-quarters
to Pombal and Coimbra, and found himself in command of
an army which, after deducting the sick and absent, numbered
<span class="sidenote">Napier.</span>
20,653 rank and file, with 30 guns. On the 9th he
left Coimbra with the main body, and arrived on the Douro,
opposite Oporto, on the 12th, after a march of eighty miles
<span class="sidenote">To D.-A.-G.
Oporto,
14 May,
1809.</span>
over infamous roads. “But,” wrote General Howorth,
“neither difficulty nor danger impedes Sir Arthur: he is all
fire, and establishes confidence in the troops.”</p>

<p>On the 10th, the left column of the army, which marched
from Aveiro, fell in with the enemy at Algabaria Nova. A
slight affair ensued, in which the Artillery and Cavalry were
chiefly engaged; and the enemy was repulsed with the loss
of a gun. On the 11th, the right column, which marched
on the Vouga, came up with the French between Algabaria
Nova and Grijon, and an engagement followed which lasted
two hours, ending in the retreat of the enemy. On the
arrival of the English at Villa Nova, opposite Oporto, it was
found that the French had destroyed the bridge across the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
Douro, and removed every available boat to their own side of
the river. It was of the utmost importance that the English
troops should cross, so as to co-operate with Marshal Beresford,
who, having crossed the river higher up, was now
menacing the left and the rear of Soult’s army. The crossing
was effected in a gallant, and yet singular and romantic
way, whose details, too long for reproduction here, render
the passage of the Douro one of the most interesting episodes
in the Peninsular War. Wellesley saw a building on
the other side of the river&mdash;here three hundred yards wide&mdash;called
the Seminary, surrounded by a walled yard, capable
of containing two battalions. Close to where he himself
stood was a rock, called Serra, from which artillery would
well command the passage of the river, and where he
therefore desired General Howorth to place eighteen guns.
The guards on the other side seemed few and negligent.
Soult expected no danger on the part of the river above the
town, and had posted himself to the westward; if, therefore,
boats could but be obtained, Wellesley resolved to cross. A
small skiff was found, and Colonel Waters, a staff officer,
crossed, and found three large barges, which he towed back
to the Villa Nova side of the river. The men were ordered
to embark, and, in the face of an army of ten thousand men,
the passage was effected. Very few, however, had crossed
ere the alarm was given, and the French troops poured
down upon the Seminary. The alarm acted in one respect
favourably to the English; for some of the citizens hastened
to unmoor some boats, and cross to Villa Nova, thus facilitating
the embarkation and passage of the troops. All this
time the fire of the Royal Artillery from the Serra told with
great effect; and, as it completely swept one side of the
Seminary, it soon limited the attack to the other. The
gallantry of the Infantry was unrivalled. General Sherbrooke
had crossed the river a little lower down, and was
now in possession of the town of Oporto, and pressing, with
the Guards and 29th Regiment, on the rear of the French
troops as they poured out towards the Seminary. The Buffs
and their comrades in the enclosure rained showers of bullets
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
on the disorganized French; and in a short time they were
<span class="sidenote">Napier.</span>
in full retreat, “the artillery, from the Serra, still searching
<span class="sidenote">To D.-A.-G.
14 May,
1809.</span>
the enemy’s columns as they hurried along.” General
Howorth, in describing the battle, said that he never saw
anything like the gallantry of the English troops. Their
firmness was irresistible; nor could the French make any
impression; and, from the position which he occupied, he
was able to form a good opinion, as he could see everything.
<span class="sidenote">To Lord
Castlereagh,
dated
Oporto,
12 May,
1809.</span>
Sir Arthur, in his despatch announcing the victory, after
enumerating the various officers who had especially distinguished
themselves, said, in describing the services of the
regiments engaged: “I had every reason to be satisfied with
the Artillery.” That his satisfaction was also extended to
the previous operations and to the severe march of eighty
miles over most difficult country, may be gathered from
General Howorth’s words. “I have reason,” he wrote, “to
believe that Sir Arthur is perfectly satisfied with the
Artillery; and, it must be owned, never was Artillery put
to such trial.” The French ordnance captured at the
recovery of Oporto included 56 brass guns and 3 brass
howitzers. A considerable supply of ammunition was also
taken.</p>

<p>The pursuit of Soult’s army was undertaken by Sir A.
Wellesley with as little delay as possible, although not with
sufficient promptness to satisfy the demands of certain military
critics, who are ready to find fault, but slow to acknowledge
difficulties in the way of armies. That it was
sufficiently prompt to ensure the success of the English
General’s purpose, may be gathered from the fact that on
the 18th May Soult and his army crossed the frontier into
Spain, having been driven out of Portugal with the loss of
artillery, stores, and baggage, and of no fewer than 6000
men; while of those who remained, many were without arms
<span class="sidenote">Napier.</span>
and accoutrements, the majority without shoes, and all
utterly exhausted and miserable; and, further, that the
English army did not delay in the pursuit from any effeminate
ideas of comfort or luxury, may be gathered from the
following letter from General Howorth: “The extraordinary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
<span class="sidenote">To General
Macleod,
dated
Oporto,
24 May,
1809.</span>
rapidity of events in this country, which have been
accompanied by a succession of the most triumphant
operations against the enemy, left me no leisure to communicate
them as they occurred. However, I am at last
returned here, after passing eight days in continued
marches over the worst roads I ever saw, through incessant
rain, a depopulated country, quartered in uninhabited
houses, and with no supplies whatever, but what
was scantily provided by the Commissariat Department.
During the greater part of this march the luxury of a
bed, or a change of clothes, which were always wet, was unknown
to me.... We pursued to Montalagree, where
the enemy turned short to the left, over the mountains,
and took the shortest way into Galicia.”</p>

<p>During the pursuit, the English overtook Soult at Salamonde,
and his rear-guard being in a confined space, some
guns were brought to bear on them with fearful effect.
<span class="sidenote">Napier.</span>
“Man and horse, crushed together, went over into the gulf;
and the bridge, rocks, and the defile beyond were strewed
with mangled bodies.” The furious peasantry also turned
on the French troops, and rendered their retreat&mdash;which has
been compared with that of the English on Corunna&mdash;infinitely
more horrible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington
Despatches.</div>

<p>As Soult sacrificed artillery and baggage in order to move
more rapidly, it was but natural that he should outmarch an
army which had not so disencumbered itself. But this pursuit
has an importance to the Artilleryman in being a text
on which much useful argument was hung by General
Howorth and others, in favour of greater mobility than had
yet attended the brigades of Field Artillery employed in
the Peninsula. The 3-pounder brigade was the only one
which was able to march with the army during its more
<span class="sidenote">Dated
Oporto,
24 May,
1809.</span>
rapid movements; and therefore General Howorth made a
demand for additional brigades of that nature, suggesting,
with the assistance of Colonel Robe, various improvements
in the equipment. Among other changes, he recommended
double instead of single draught, both for guns and waggons;
and that the brigades should be of four guns instead of six,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
the howitzers being dispensed with, and a liberal supply of
spherical case being issued for the guns. Another very
suggestive recommendation was made by him: “to have a
small forge with each brigade of four guns; the forge to
be placed on the frame of a small limber waggon; <i>it can
then follow the brigade, which is not the case with the present
one</i>.” The absence of a forge on the line of march must
at times have sadly crippled the batteries. He also suggested
that the span of the wheels should be narrowed to
4½ feet, and (to prevent liability to upset from this cause)
that the gun should be lowered on its carriage by adopting
<i>a bare iron axletree</i>. His next recommendation reveals a
starvation of equipment which would account for almost any
shortcomings on the line of march. He urged the authorities
“to have spare shafts, wheels, axles, spokes, felloes,
and pintails supplied, <i>none having been sent with the
present brigades</i>, and now much needed.” He also made
suggestions which would ensure greater mobility to the
heavier brigades of 6-pounders. The Artilleryman may
therefore date to the campaign of the Douro some of the
most valuable lessons taught in the Peninsular War, and can
trace to it that change in the opinions and experience of the
military authorities, which resulted in so extended a use of
Horse Artillery in the Peninsula, and in so marked an improvement
in the brigades of Field Artillery before the conclusion
of the war.</p>

<p>Marshal Victor, on hearing of the disastrous termination
of Soult’s operations, fell back on Almaraz and Torremocha;
so that Sir A. Wellesley, who had commenced his southward
march through Traz-oz-Montes, resolved to halt at Abrantes,
and to commence a thorough reorganization of his army,
<span class="sidenote">Wellington
Despatches
and
Supplementary
Despatches.</span>
now sadly undisciplined. The correspondence of Sir Arthur
at this time reveals what one is apt to forget in reflecting on
the glories of the Peninsular campaigns. The military
genius of the Duke of Wellington and the courage of English
soldiers are too often considered to have been the only
necessary causes of success; but a study of the appeals
made by him at Abrantes to officers and men,&mdash;of the strict
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
orders, on even the smallest matters, which he found it necessary
to issue,&mdash;and of the letters to ministers and friends,
in which he never failed to tell the truth about the army,
however unpalatable,&mdash;reveals another most necessary element
in the success which attended him in all his operations.
As the first thought in his own mind always was <i>duty</i>, so the
first and last thing which he held before his troops, as that
without which they would be worse than useless, was <i>discipline</i>.
The arguments he used have a value for all time,
and a special value for England at a time when she possesses
an armed force of Volunteers, who might possibly consider
that drill, instead of discipline, is the chief end of a soldier’s
life; but whose discipline, on the other hand, if thorough,
would be nobler than that of regular troops, in being more
self-imposed, and less dependent on a penal code. As for
the Duke of Wellington’s remarks on the discipline of the
Spanish troops, they apply in a singularly exact way to the
<span class="sidenote">To Lord
Castlereagh,
dated
25 Aug.
1809.</span>
armies of Spain in the anarchy of 1873. “In Spain,” he
wrote, “the business of an army is little understood. They
are really children in the art of war; and I cannot say
that they do anything as it ought to be done, with the
exception of running away and assembling again in a
state of nature.... The Government have attempted
to govern the kingdom in a state of revolution by an adherence
to old rules and systems, and with the aid of what
is called <i>enthusiasm</i>; and this last is, in fact, no aid to accomplish
anything, and is only an excuse for the irregularity
with which everything is done, and for the want of
discipline and subordination of the armies. People are
very apt to believe that enthusiasm carried the French
through their Revolution, and was the parent of those
exertions which have nearly conquered the world; but if
the subject is nicely examined, it will be found that enthusiasm
was the <i>name</i> only, but that <i>force</i> was the instrument
which brought forward those great resources, under
the system of <i>terror</i>, which first stopped the Allies.” In
his correspondence with Marshal Beresford, who found great
difficulty in organizing the Portuguese troops, he laid down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
<span class="sidenote">Dated
Badajoz,
8 Sept.
1809.</span>
what may be considered a military creed. “They want the
habits,” he wrote, “and the spirit of soldiers,&mdash;the habits
of command on one side, and of obedience on the other&mdash;mutual
confidence between officers and men: and, above
all, a determination in the superiors to obey the spirit of
the orders they receive, let what will be the consequence;
and the spirit to tell the true cause, if they do not.” Poor
Marshal Beresford had, indeed, need of support and sympathy
<span class="sidenote">Supplementary
Despatches
of Duke of
Wellington,
vol. vi.
p. 362.</span>
in his task. Long habits of disregard to duty, and
of consequent laziness, made it impossible for the senior
officers to pay any regular or continued attention to the
duties of their situations, and neither reward nor punishment
would induce them to bear up against fatigue. By
replacing these by younger officers, or English officers detached
from the various regiments, he ultimately succeeded
in making the Portuguese contingent a most valuable force;
but this was only done by impressing on them the necessity
of discipline and unhesitating obedience. More than sixty
years have passed away, and the same lesson, though more
difficult to learn, is not the less vitally necessary. The spirit
of criticism spreads with the growth of education, and considerably
out of proportion with it. The reasoning obedience
which a soldier should yield is, perhaps, confused with
an obedience which requires to know the reason of an order,
instead of that which is readily yielded in the belief that
what may be unintelligible in detail is necessary for the
general plan. That such obedience is not easy always to
give may be true enough. The possession, with a strong
will, of but pigmy power, is undoubtedly trying; but the
self-denial which is demanded stands among the highest of
all military virtues, as it is the very alphabet of all military
training. He only is fit to rule who has first learned to
obey.</p>

<p>Reference has been made to the association of English
officers with the Portuguese forces. The appointment of
Captain&mdash;afterwards Sir Alexander&mdash;Dickson, to the Portuguese
Artillery, which took place after the Douro campaign,
was productive of so important results, that it deserves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
detailed notice. As Captain Dickson, he had acted as Brigade-Major
to General Howorth during the recent operations.
He had, however, come to Portugal with the intention
of obtaining employment in a higher local rank with
the Portuguese Artillery, and had only been deterred by
difficulties which had arisen as to the <i>status</i> and pay of
officers so attached. On the 4th June, he quitted Oporto
with General Howorth, who had been indisposed for some
time, and proceeded to Abrantes to join the army, and
also to speak to Marshal Beresford on the subject of employment
<span class="sidenote">Captain
Dickson to
D. A. Gen.

with the Portuguese troops. Fortunately, on his
arrival, he found that Captain May, then in command of a
division of Portuguese Field Artillery, was on the point of
resigning, in accordance with instructions from England;
and Marshal Beresford readily appointed Captain Dickson
as his successor,&mdash;Captain May, in exchange, assuming the
duties of Major of Brigade. So far all was well; but Captain
Dickson soon found that he had no pleasing position.
The local rank of Major, which had been conferred on his
junior officer, Captain Arentschild of the King’s German
Artillery, was refused to him by Marshal Beresford, who had
been irritated by contradictory orders from the English and
Portuguese Governments; so that he found himself under
the orders of his junior. The Portuguese officers were also
very jealous of their English comrades; and the seniors,
without incurring any risk themselves, made every difficulty
in their power, when any suggestion was made which they
disliked. Letters from the British to the Portuguese officers
on official matters, and all applications for supplies, were left
unanswered; and yet “these same men,” wrote Captain
Dickson indignantly, “are embracing you as often as they
meet!” He would gladly have given up his new appointment,
had he not felt bound by his promise to Lord Chatham
to retain it; so he set to work, in a true soldierlike spirit,
to perfect the two 6-pounder Portuguese batteries which
had been placed under his charge, and of which, even at the
beginning, he was able to write in terms of the warmest
approbation. As this narrative will show, he was rewarded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
for remaining at his post. The local rank was given to him
ultimately; and by its means he found himself commanding
many brother officers, much senior to himself regimentally,
and ultimately at the head of the Artillery of the armies of
the Duke of Wellington, while only a Captain in his own
Corps.</p>

<p>It is now necessary to follow the movements of Sir Arthur
Wellesley. The English Government continued to overrate
the value of the Spanish armies; and the pressure brought
to bear upon the English General was such as he could not
resist. He therefore proposed to the Spanish General,
Cuesta, to co-operate with his army against Victor’s forces,
and ultimately against Madrid. Cuesta, whose treatment
of Sir Arthur Wellesley was, on all occasions, of the most
obstinate and boorish description, had an army of 33,000 men.
<span class="sidenote">Napier.</span>
Sir Arthur’s army, when he quitted Abrantes, numbered
20,997 men of all arms, with 30 guns. The advance of the
united armies against Madrid by the valley of the Tagus
had been foreseen by Napoleon, and he had ordered Soult,
at the head of a powerful army, to concentrate his forces in
such a manner that, on the advance of Wellesley, he could
pass by his left rear, and cut him off from the base of his
operations,&mdash;Lisbon and its surrounding country. The English
General was far from correctly informed either of the
strength or position of Soult’s army; he was urged by the
English representative, Mr. Frere, and by his own Government,
to take the offensive; the vacillation of Joseph Buonaparte
tempted him to march on Madrid before further union
could be effected among the French armies; he was further
assured of the courage of the Spanish armies, the enthusiasm
of the peasantry, and the abundance of supplies. On
the 27th June, therefore, he broke up his camp at Abrantes,
and marched towards Oropesa, to effect a junction with
Cuesta. The farther he advanced, the more doubtful did he
become of the sincerity of the Spaniards&mdash;a doubt which
exhibited itself in the pertinacity with which he demanded
from Cuesta and the Junta solemn promises to keep the
English army supplied, during any farther advance, with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
requisite transport and supplies. The reader does not require
to be reminded how shamefully these promises were
broken;&mdash;how thwarted Wellesley was, alike by the intrigues
of the Junta and the conceited obstinacy of Cuesta;&mdash;nor
how faithful he was, amid all his difficulties, to the duty
which England had imposed upon him. Standing beside
Cuesta like a better angel,&mdash;and receiving the treatment not
unfrequently bestowed on such,&mdash;calm under insult, his judgment
never heated by an indignation which would have been
righteous,&mdash;he ultimately succeeded in placing the united
armies in the very position in front of Talavera which he
had selected, when he saw that a general action with the
combined forces of Victor and Sebastiani was inevitable, if
not, indeed, desirable. But not until the morning of the
27th July, nor until Cuesta’s folly and rashness had courted
and received, at Alcabon, a well-deserved defeat, did the
English General succeed in placing the Spanish forces in
<span class="sidenote">Gurwood’s
Despatches:
Selections,
p. 278.</span>
the position he had chosen. The quiet irony of the memorandum
of Sir Arthur Wellesley on the battle of Talavera
cannot be seen without remembering the defeat just mentioned,
and a disgraceful panic which seized on the Spanish
troops at the appearance of some French cavalry, on the
afternoon of the 27th, when 10,000 Infantry and all their
Artillery fled, terror-stricken, to the rear. Part of these
were recovered before the following day; but the Spanish
contingent was weaker by the greater part of its Artillery,
and 6000 of its Infantry. With such troops as allies, no
wonder that Sir Arthur wrote: “The position of Talavera
was well calculated for the troops that were to occupy it.
The ground in front of the British army was open; that
in front of the Spanish army was covered with olive-trees,
intersected by roads, ditches, &amp;c.” In other words, the
offensive part of the battle was to fall on the British, while
a masterly and imposing inactivity was reserved for the
Spaniards.</p>

<p>The battle of Talavera was fought on the 27th and 28th
July. The loss of the Spanish Artillery in the panic mentioned
above was very serious, as the English had only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
30 guns, very badly horsed and of small calibre, to oppose
to 80 guns, admirably served by the enemy. Fortunately,
the few guns of the Spanish Artillery, which <i>were</i> brought
into action, were gallantly fought; and of those of the Royal
and King’s German Artillery, both the officers present and
all military historians speak in the highest terms. At the
defeat of the 4th French Corps by Campbell’s division, the
British Artillery, as Napier wrote, played vehemently upon
their masses:&mdash;at the critical moment, later in the day,
when the English centre was almost broken on account of
the injudicious advance of the Guards, and of the confusion
which seized the King’s German Legion, the marvellous
effect which followed the arrival of the 48th Regiment,
moving, amid all the confusion, with the steadiness, of a
parade, was greatly heightened by the conduct of the Artillery,
which, as the same historian says, “battered the enemy’s
flanks without intermission.” Sir Arthur Wellesley, in
addition to an expression of his satisfaction with the Corps
in the General Order after the battle, made use of the following
expression in his despatch to Lord Castlereagh:
“The Artillery, under Brigadier-General Howorth, was also,
throughout these days, of the greatest service.”</p>

<p>Compared with the loss of the other arms, that of the
Artillery was but small. On the 27th, only two men were
wounded; on the 28th, the loss was as follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Royal Artillery.&mdash;1 officer and 7 men killed; 3 officers and 21 men
wounded.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King’s German Artillery.&mdash;1 sergeant and 2 men killed; 3 sergeants
and 27 men wounded.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The officer who was killed was Lieutenant Wyatt; those
who were wounded were Lieut.-Colonel Framingham, and
Captains Baines and Taylor. In reporting the severe wound
of Colonel Framingham, and applying for a pension, General
Howorth said: “If it were possible that any testimony or
<span class="sidenote">To D.-A.-G.
Dated
Badajoz,
20 Oct.
1809.</span>
praise of mine could add to the weight of this application,
or to the merit and brilliancy of Lieut.-Colonel Framingham’s
gallant conduct in the action of the 28th July,
at Talavera, I should most freely have bestowed it; but, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
he distinguished himself on that occasion by a most skilful
discharge of his duty, I have only to wish him sincerely a
reward equal to his merits.” On the retreat of the army
from Talavera, Captain Taylor, whose wound prevented his
removal, fell into the hands of the French, and remained a
prisoner to the end of the war.</p>

<p>There are several points connected with the battle of
Talavera which stand out prominently, and seize the attention
of the student at once. The weakness of King Joseph
in playing into the hands of the English General, and allowing
him to fight under the terms most advantageous to
himself;&mdash;the hard, honest fighting, as Napier calls it, of the
English troops, who, for hours, were closely engaged with a
force of double their own numbers;&mdash;the watchful tactics of
Sir A. Wellesley, who never missed a point during the whole
engagement, and was always ready at critical moments with
the necessary remedies; and the heavy losses on both sides&mdash;over
6000 being killed and wounded on the side of the English,
and more than 7000 on that of the French;&mdash;these are
points which cannot escape the most superficial reader. But
to the soldier there are several precious instances of steadiness
and discipline among particular regiments, which
<span class="sidenote">Wellington
Despatches.</span>
shed a glow over this well-fought field,&mdash;the 45th and
5th Battalion of the 60th being conspicuous for these qualities
on the 27th, and the “stubborn old 48th” on the 28th.
Napier’s pages glow with the enthusiasm of a soldier as
he describes the movements of the last-mentioned regiment
on the occasion referred to above. “At first,” he writes,
“it seemed as if this regiment must be carried away by the
retiring crowds; but, wheeling back by companies, it let
them pass through the intervals, and then, resuming its
proud and beautiful line, marched against the right of
the pursuing columns, and plied them with such a
destructive musketry, and closed upon them with such
a firm and regular pace, that their forward movement was
checked.”</p>

<p>The changes which have become necessary in the art of
war, owing to the improvement in fire-arms, may have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
forbidden the use in battle of the line which the gallant
48th showed at Talavera; but, in whatever form troops may
be called upon to fight, the qualities which animated that
regiment will still, if present, entitle their possessors to the
same epithet, and the perfection of their drill and discipline
will still claim the words, “proud and beautiful.”</p>

<p>The horrors of a battle-field, when the deadly encounter is
over, were aggravated at Talavera by a fire, which caught
the dry grass, and which licked the ground where the dead
and wounded were lying, adding a new agony to the sufferings
of the latter, and hideously scorching the bodies of
those whose pain was for ever at an end. This incident gives
a ghastly element to the recollection of a field, on which
English courage was so ably proved.</p>

</p>

<p>On the 29th, Wellesley’s army was strengthened by the
arrival of Crawford’s brigade, consisting of the 43rd, 52nd,
and 95th Regiments, with Captain Ross’s, “The Chestnut,”
troop of Horse Artillery,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> which, in their eagerness to reach
the field of battle, and undeterred by the lies of the flying
Spaniards, had marched no less than sixty-two miles in
twenty-six hours, in the hottest season of the year, and in
heavy marching order. But news reached the English General
which determined him to fall back, and to have done
with the assistance of Spanish troops, whose worthlessness
he had now thoroughly tested. Hearing that Soult was
pressing on by rapid marches, and with increased forces,&mdash;had
already gained possession of one of his most important
communications with Portugal, and was threatening the
others,&mdash;he resolved to leave his wounded at Talavera, and
to fall back into Portugal. He did so by means of rapid
marches; but he still conducted them so as to show no
appearance of flight, such as would have injured the reputation

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
of his army in the eyes of the Spaniards&mdash;a most important

consideration. General Howorth, in alluding to
the retreat from Talavera, emphasises this point. “We
made a retrograde movement,” he wrote, “with a dignified
deliberation perfectly suitable to the gravity of Spanish
deportment.” The whole of his brigades of Artillery
returned from Talavera complete, with the exception of one
6-pounder gun which had been damaged in the battle of
the 28th, and which, the General wrote, had been <i>privately
buried</i>, perhaps out of consideration for Spanish deportment
also. But all the spare ammunition and stores had to be
abandoned, as the carts were required to carry the sick.
No less than 150 carts were so employed; for the sickness
during the retreat, and even after the troops went into
cantonments at Merida, was very great. The well-known
sickness in the Chestnut Troop, which so nearly led to its
return to England, took place at Merida after the retreat.
So severely did it suffer, that, in sending in his returns
of available Artillery force at this time, General Howorth
wrote: “I have one troop of Horse Artillery, Bull’s,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> and
half a one, Ross’s. The latter has suffered severely by
sickness and death of men and horses.” The sickness was
aggravated by a dearth of medical officers; and the unfortunate
Chestnut Troop, which required medical assistance to
an extraordinary extent, was robbed of its own surgeon in an
inglorious manner. “Poor Doctor O’Brien,” wrote General
Howorth, “of Ross’s troop, died last night, owing to his
servant’s getting drunk, and giving him too strong a dose
of opium, which destroyed him.” Ere many weeks passed,
the attempt to cope with the havoc made in the troop was
almost abandoned. Two guns and their waggons were sent
into store, from want of men and horses to work them; and
orders were given that, on the arrival of another troop
(Lefebure’s) from England, the surviving men and horses of
the Chestnut Troop should be handed over to it, and Captain
Ross and his officers return to England to organize a new
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
troop. Luckily for him, Captain Lefebure’s troop suffered
so much from a storm on its way to the Peninsula that, on
its arrival, it was little more efficient than the one it was
<span class="sidenote">Memoir of
Sir H. D.

meant to relieve; so, to Captain Ross’s delight, he had his
vacancies completed from the new arrivals, and Captain
Lefebure had, instead, the duty of rebuilding his troop.</p>

<p>The head-quarters of the English General, on whom the
title of Lord Wellington was bestowed after Talavera, were
at Badajoz until the end of 1809. He devoted himself to
the strengthening of his position, with the double motive of
ensuring to himself the possession of Lisbon and the Tagus,
and of securing the unmolested embarkation of his troops,
should reverses render it necessary. The lines of Torres
Vedras, which were to play so important a part in the campaign
of 1810, were matured in the winter of 1809. Lord
Wellington had given up all hope of succeeding by means
of the Spaniards; but he by no means despaired of offering
an effectual resistance to the most powerful French attacks
by means of the combined English and Portuguese army
under his command. He felt confidence in his troops. As
<span class="sidenote">Lord Wellington
to Colonel
Malcolm,
Badajoz,
3 Dec.
1809.</span>
he boasted to a correspondent, “I command an unanimous
army.” Supplies in Portugal were better arranged than
in Spain; and, with the remembrance fresh in his mind of
Talavera, which he himself pronounced “the hardest-fought
battle of modern days, and the most glorious in its results
to the English troops,” he looked forward to the next
campaign with quiet confidence, and displayed during the
winter an industry in strengthening his position which, at
all events, deserved success.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Although the Peninsular War eclipses in point of interest any
other operations in which the Royal Artillery was engaged in 1809, it would
be a great omission, were no allusion made to the services of the Corps, in the
beginning of 1809, during the operations in the West Indies under General
Beckwith and Sir George Prevost, which resulted in the capture of the
French colonies of Cayenne and Martinique. Over 500 officers and men
of the Royal Artillery were present under the command of Brigadier-General
Stehelin, and the value of their services may be ascertained from

<p>“To Brigadier-General Stehelin, commanding the Royal Artillery, for
his regularity in all interior arrangements, and especially for that order
and system established in this distinguished Corps, which led to those
eminent services rendered by them during the bombardment, and which
brought the siege to an early and glorious termination ... the Commander
of the Forces is anxious to renew all those assurances of public
and individual consideration, to which from their distinguished services
they are fully entitled, and he requests, as an old soldier, that he may
live in their remembrance and friendship.”</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> may not be uninteresting to the reader, before resuming
the consideration of the Peninsular War, to study some
statistics connected with the Regiment in the year 1810, the
period to be treated of in this chapter. The number of
troops and companies remained as before, 112&mdash;exclusive of
the invalid battalion. They were distributed as follows:&mdash;16
<span class="sidenote">Kane’s
List.</span>
in the Peninsula, 5 in Italy and Sicily, 56 on home
stations, 4 in Canada, 3 at the Cape of Good Hope, 3 in
Ceylon, where they had been engaged on active service
during the previous year, 6 in Gibraltar, 4 in Jamaica and
6 in the rest of the West Indies (these ten companies being
actively engaged in the defence of the colonies), 1 in Madeira,
4 in Malta, 1 in Newfoundland, and 3 in Nova Scotia and
Cape Breton.</p>

<p>The following tables show the strength of the battalions,
and the proportions of the various ranks. They also show
the pay of the various ranks, <i>less</i> the charges for agency,
which are not deducted in the pay tables published in
Kane’s List. But, in addition to the strength of the Royal
Artillery, the reader will find detailed statements of the
other corps which swelled the total Artillery force of Great
Britain. It is hoped that, by publishing these tables in this
form, reference will be easier, and lengthy description may
be dispensed with. It cannot be too often repeated that the
services in the Peninsula of the King’s German Artillery,
the detail of which is given in the annexed tables, were of
the most gallant description, unsurpassed by those of the
corps to which they were attached. The active service of
the corps, named the Royal Foreign Artillery, was chiefly
in the West Indies.

<p>The recruiting for the Regiment during the year 1809 had
been successful, no fewer than 1820 gunners and 868 drivers
having been enlisted. The establishment just given was
nearly maintained, and even occasionally exceeded, during
1810; and the usual decrease, caused by the discharge of
men by purchase, did not occur during that year, all such
discharges being forbidden. A falling off in the strength of
the Regiment became apparent, however, in the winter
of 1810.</p>

<p>The “wear and tear” among the horses of the Royal Horse
Artillery and the Royal Artillery Driver Corps had been
excessive during the year 1809, owing to the Peninsular
Campaigns and the Scheldt Expedition. No fewer than
2786 had either died or been destroyed; and 3367 had to be
purchased to compensate for these losses, and to meet the
ever-increasing demand. Very large numbers were sent to
Portugal during the year 1810; and, owing to the consequent
<span class="sidenote">D.-A.-Gen.

Howorth,

increase in the numbers of the Driver Corps attached
to Lord Wellington’s armies, it was decided to appoint a
field officer to command them. This duty, with cavalry pay,
was given to Colonel Robe.</p>

<p>The numerical force of Artillery, serving under General
Howorth in the Peninsula, in the end of 1809, was as
follows.

<p>The following tables will show that before a year had
elapsed a very considerable increase to this force had taken
place; and are also useful, as showing the companies which
were present, and the names of the senior officers. (<i>See opposite
page.</i>)</p>

<p>It is difficult, without a study of the correspondence of
this period, to realise the energy with which General
Macleod endeavoured to meet the wants of the Regiment
abroad. Unfortunately, there was not similar energy in the
other public departments. Large reinforcements, both of
men and horses, were ready early in the summer of 1810;
but no ships could be found for their conveyance until the
end of December. From the nature of these drafts, and
from various remarks in General Macleod’s letters, it was
clear that the remonstrances made by the various officers
concerned on the subject of the want of mobility of the field
brigades had produced their effect, and the rapid increase in
the force of Horse Artillery in the Peninsula which took
place between 1810 and 1814 was the consequence. Anticipating
that Lord Wellington would prefer a complete
troop of Horse Artillery to more of the sluggish field
brigades, General Macleod suggested that the remnant of
Captain Lefebure’s troop, which was under orders for England,
should remain in Portugal; and he despatched men
and horses to complete it in that country. At the same time
he did everything in his power to improve the field brigades
in the point of mobility, by sending out large numbers of
horses. No fewer than 500 were embarked in the first week
of January 1811.

<p>The force in the Mediterranean garrisons, which was considered
available in event of sudden demands from the
Peninsula, appears in the following tables (<i>see pp.</i> 271 <i>and</i>
272), which also show the names of the senior officers. With
these the statistics for the year to be treated in this chapter
will terminate, and the consideration of the campaign be
resumed.</p>

<p>The campaign of 1810 in the Peninsula was, in one sense,
the least active of any during the war. Napoleon certainly
made a great effort to completely subdue the country, and
to expel the English armies. For this purpose, Marshal
Massena was placed in command of the French troops; but
the duty proved to be beyond his powers. It is doubtful if
in any period of the Duke of Wellington’s military career he
displayed more ability, more patience, more foresight, than
he showed during the first nine months of the year 1810.
Not merely had he to contend with local influences, but he
failed to secure the requisite support from the English
Government. There was at home a fear of losing power,
which led English statesmen to commit unworthy actions,
and to display a nervousness in administration, which
demoralized such of their agents as were not above the
ordinary standard. The wisdom of publishing the private
letters of a great man is certainly questionable; but once
published, they become the historian’s legitimate property.

graphic picture of the Government in 1810. “What,” he
wrote to Admiral Berkeley, “can be expected from men who
are beaten in the House of Commons three times a week?

A great deal might be done now, if there existed in
England less party, and more public sentiment&mdash;and
if there was any Government.” Again, in pleading his
inability to carry out certain operations, he urged, in a letter
to the Right Hon. H. Wellesley, that he would have been able
to do so, “if the Government possessed any strength, or

desire to have anything done but what is <i>safe</i> and <i>cheap</i>.”
The same hands that applauded the conqueror at Talavera
strove, in timorous anxiety, to drag him back from any
further operations. The terror of the French armies, which
had obtained possession of the Portuguese Government and
people, seems to have reached London. The Government
despatches to Lord Wellington breathed nothing but advice
to guide him <i>when he should be expelled from Portugal</i>.
While <i>he</i> was ensuring in a masterly manner the safety of
Lisbon, <i>they</i> were urging on him the claims of Cadiz. Their
letters and the tone of the public press swelled the despondency,
the presence of which in Portugal Lord Wellington
lamented; and his protests, assuring the Government that
he had left nothing undone,&mdash;whether the event should be
defeat or victory,&mdash;were treated as idle words, or as the heated
expression of a mere soldier’s hopes. Had Wellington been
a weaker man, the lines of Torres Vedras had been got ready
in vain, the battle of Busaco had never been fought, and
the unpaid arrears of the French troops would have been
liquidated by the plundering of Lisbon and Oporto.</p>

<p>But his difficulties were not confined to the chilling advice
of the Government. At a time when he required the best
men in the army to aid him, the exercise of home patronage
inflicted on him the most incapable assistants. Not merely
did he suffer from useless subordinate staff officers, but even
his general officers were not always what he wished.
<span class="sidenote">Supplementary
Despatches,
vol. vi.
p. 582.</span>
“Really,” he wrote to Colonel Torrens, “when I reflect
upon the characters and attainments of some of the
general officers of this army, and consider that these are
the persons on whom I am to rely to lead columns against
the French Generals, and who are to carry my instructions
into execution, I tremble; and, as Lord Chesterfield said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
of the Generals of his day, ‘I only hope that when the
enemy reads the list of their names, he trembles as I do.’”
And at the very time that these men were being sent out to
him, he was debarred from offering reward, in the shape of
promotion, to any one under his command whose gallantry
might seem to him to have earned it. No subject is more
frequently alluded to in his letters than this. The Government
would gladly make political capital out of his successes,&mdash;would
greedily gather votes by making appointments to his
army, but declined to strengthen him by trusting his military
knowledge, or increasing his legitimate authority.</p>

<p>But the aggravation to which he had to submit in 1810
did not cease here. While the French were advancing into
Portugal, and the English Government as little realised the
strength of the lines which Wellington had prepared for his
troops as Massena himself, the cry was always to embark,&mdash;to
quit Lisbon,&mdash;to devote his energies to Cadiz; yet when
strategical reasons and absolute necessity compelled him to
leave Ciudad Rodrigo to its fate, the same voices, in querulous
terror, remonstrated with him on his inaction. When he
gained the victory of Busaco, the first idea with the Government
was, not recognition of his merits, but political capital.
And when, after a fruitless and self-destructive residence
before the lines of Torres Vedras, Massena was obliged to
retire from Portugal, who so loud in their cries for pursuit
as the very men who had scoffed at the bare possibility of
offering resistance to the French invaders?</p>

<p>The year 1810 was, however, not merely a year which
tested the marvellous ability and patience of Wellington;&mdash;it
was also the year which placed on the Portuguese troops the
seal of ability to face their dreaded French enemies. At
Busaco, the courage of the Portuguese, under English discipline,
was nobly manifested,&mdash;and the value of this discovery
<span class="sidenote">Supplementary
Despatches,
vol. vi.
p. 606.</span>
was beyond expression at that most critical time. As Lord
Wellington said, the battle had the best effect in inspiring
confidence in the Portuguese troops; it removed an impression,
which had been general, that the English intended
to fight no more, but to retire to their ships; and it gave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
the Portuguese a taste for an amusement to which they were
not before accustomed, and which they would not have
acquired in a position less strong than that of Busaco. Had
the battle been productive of no other gain than this, it
ought to have found favour with a Government, whose
members desired that their successes might be “<i>cheap</i>.”</p>

<p>When the campaign commenced, the head-quarters of the
English army were at Celorico; and Almeida and Ciudad
Rodrigo were organized for defence. The latter city, which
was defended by Spaniards, capitulated on the 10th July,
after a month’s siege; and Almeida, a small place with a
Portuguese garrison, followed suit on the 28th August.
During the siege of the latter place, the combat of the Coa,
as it was termed, took place; and, as the Chestnut Troop
took part in it, it deserves some notice. Crawford, who commanded
the Light Division, and had the outpost duties to
perform, had retired before the French, after the fall of
Ciudad Rodrigo, under the walls of Almeida. The position
which he took up was very dangerous. The river Coa,
crossed by a single bridge, was in his rear, and an open
country in front. He had been ordered to cross this river
on the approach of the French, but had foolishly remained&mdash;with
a small force of 5000 men and one battery of Artillery,
the Chestnut Troop&mdash;awaiting the arrival of Ney’s force, of
more than three times the number. Regardless of the fire
from the guns of Almeida, Ney availed himself of Crawford’s
blunder, and attacked him with vehemence. The crossing of
the bridge, now absolutely necessary, was most difficult, and
could not have been effected but for the gallantry of the
regiments, and the precision of the fire of the Chestnut Troop,
which had been sent across the bridge early in the affair to occupy
some rising ground, and to cover the retreat of the other
troops. The bridge was crowded by the retiring columns of
the English, so as to be almost impassable; and when, ultimately,
the whole had succeeded in crossing, the pursuing
columns of the French blocked the passage in a similar
manner, and, under a heavy fire, were reduced into heaps of
killed and wounded, level with the parapet of the bridge. A
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
<span class="sidenote">Cust.</span>
tremendous storm of rain, which set in, flooded the pans of
the French muskets, and put an end to the engagement,
which, in point of losses, had been on both sides very severe.
Of the Artillery on this occasion, Napier wrote that it played
on both sides across the river and ravine, the sounds repeated
by numberless echoes, and the smoke, slowly rising,
resolving itself into an immense arch, spanning the whole
chasm and sparkling with the whirling fuzes of the flying
shells. Cust, in his ‘Annals of the Wars,’ describes the Chestnut
Troop, from the high ground, sending well-directed shot
over the heads of the skirmishers. The gallant officer who
<span class="sidenote">‘Memoirs
of Sir H.
Ross,’
pp. 11, 12.</span>
commanded the troop wrote as follows: “General Crawford
ordered a retreat. Lieutenant Bourchier, of the Artillery,
brought me the order to retire, as rapidly as in my power,
across the bridge, and to get my guns into position on the
opposite heights. At this time we had five guns in action....
Our fire was excellent, and broke them two or
three times.” Captain Ross’s brother, an officer of Engineers,
who was serving with the army, writes of this
combat of the 24th July: “Hew’s guns did their duty.”
The loss on the English side during this engagement was
over three hundred killed and wounded; that of the French
was over a thousand.</p>

<p>But a battle on a larger scale has now to be mentioned.
Lord Wellington retreated towards Coimbra, followed by
Marshal Massena on the north hank of the Mondego. The
English General resolved to make a stand on the Sierra de
Busaco, a high ridge which extends from the Mondego in a
northerly direction about eight miles. In the battle which
followed, Lord Wellington displayed an ignorance of Artillery
tactics, from the results of which he was happily saved by
the intelligence and gallantry of the representatives of that
arm. This want of knowledge, which he never overcame,
was the cause of a not unfrequent irritation against Artillery
<span class="sidenote">Capt. T. B,
Strange,
R.A., on
Practical
Artillery.</span>
as an arm, and a tendency to depreciate its value. At Busaco,
instead of massing his Artillery in reserve until the
attack should develop itself, the guns were placed, as a rule,
in the easiest parts of the position, where it was supposed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
the French <i>would</i> attack; and they were massed in these
positions so as to form an excellent mark for the enemy’s
fire. This was more especially the case with Major Arentschild’s
6-pounder and 9-pounder brigades of Portuguese
Artillery. Fortunately, the Artillery was well served, and,
<span class="sidenote">‘Life of Sir
J. Burgoyne,’
vol. 1.</span>
as Sir John Burgoyne wrote, “the guns had great effect.”
Captain Thompson’s company of the 7th Battalion&mdash;now
D Battery, 11th Brigade, Royal Artillery, was of essential
service, although it was broken up into divisions during the
<span class="sidenote">MS. Letter
among
Cleaveland’s MSS.</span>
battle. Captain Lane, who was 2nd Captain of the company,
thus describes the conduct of one division: “My men
did their duty. Lieutenant F. Bayley’s conduct was admirable.
It was the first time he had been in action, and
no old soldier could have acted better. The French Voltigeurs
(37th Regiment) came close to the guns; and one
was killed only eight paces off. An immense column
showing themselves in the ravine, we, with three cheers,
gave them a few rounds of case and round-shot together,
at about seventy paces distance, which drove them back.”
The same officer, who was quoted above as alluding to the
services of his brother’s troop at the Coa, wrote of Busaco:
<span class="sidenote">‘Memoirs
of Sir H. D.
Ross.’</span>
“I will venture to assert that the greatest loss the enemy
sustained was by our Artillery; and the guns that had
the most duty, and, I believe I might say, that were best
placed for effect&mdash;even if nothing is said of the admirable
manner in which the guns were fought&mdash;were those of
Hew’s troop.... Several officers who remained on
the field the day after the retreat, among others General
Crawford himself, were convinced, more than those who
only looked on it from the heights, of the immense
slaughter the enemy sustained from the Shrapnel shells
thrown from my brother’s guns, aided for a short time
by those of Captain Bull’s troop.” This opinion, which,
coming from a brother, might perhaps be considered more
indulgent than just, was confirmed by the great historian of
the war. In the resistance offered to the attack of Loison’s
division, Napier says that Ross’s guns were worked with
incredible quickness, and their shot swept through the advancing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
columns. The attack having failed, Crawford’s
Artillery, with which was the gallant Chestnut Troop, was
equally useful against the attack of Marchaud’s division,
which followed. “It heavily smote,” writes Napier, “the
flank of Marchaud’s people in the pine-wood; and Ney,
who was there in person, after sustaining this murderous
cannonade for an hour, relinquished that attack also.”

Well might Lord Wellington say, “I am particularly indebted
to ... Brigadier-General Howorth and the
Artillery.”</p>

<p>The force under Lord Wellington’s command on this occasion
did not exceed 50,000, and extended over a distance of
eight to ten miles. The French are estimated by Napier to
have been 65,000 in number; but Wellington considered that
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
dated Pero
Negro,

they exceeded that number by 5000 men. The French loss
amounted to 4500 killed and wounded, while that of the
Allies was under 1300, the English having lost 631, and the
Portuguese 622. The absence of Artillery on the side of
the French, who overrated the difficulties of the ground,
and the great activity shown in the use and service of the
guns of the Allies, accounted for the great difference in the
number of casualties. Much of the efficacy of the fire of
the Royal Artillery was due to the use of Shrapnel’s spherical
case-shot,&mdash;a projectile which was daily increasing in
favour,&mdash;with no one more than with Lord Wellington himself.
<span class="sidenote">Dated

“At the battle of Busaco,” wrote Major May to
Colonel Shrapnel, “your shells were of the utmost use, and
their destruction plainly perceived from the heights.”</p>

<p>Marshal Massena, finding it impossible to cross the Sierra
de Busaco by either of the two direct roads, while such an
enemy lined the heights, but being resolved to press on to
Coimbra, turned the position by its left flank,&mdash;Wellington
continuing the retreat which he had varied by so noble an
episode. Massena reached Coimbra just as the English rear-guard
quitted it; and his troops were there guilty of the
grossest licence. The English army continued slowly to
retire to the lines which its prudent commander had prepared
for it; and when Massena came up he found it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
in a position which was almost impregnable, while his own
communications were interrupted, and his flanks and rear
annoyed by levies of Portuguese Militia. The lines of
Torres Vedras were an emblem of military sagacity and of
engineering skill. Seated behind them the Allied Army received
a training which proved fruitful in the campaign of
the following year; the Portuguese contingent was made
more efficient; and the folly of the Portuguese Government
received repeated rebukes from the mouth of a General
whose prudence and determination were never more clearly
shown than in the history of Torres Vedras and Busaco.
Croakers, as he wrote, might include the latter among useless
battles; but an encounter, which made each Portuguese
soldier feel himself a match for a Frenchman, was the best
assistance which fortune could throw in Lord Wellington’s
way. Having realised the value of this beforehand, his next
task was to ensure it <i>independently</i> of fortune.

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Leaving</span> Massena in front of Torres Vedras, the reader is
requested to turn towards Cadiz. Here Spanish pride
had long resisted offers of English assistance, hoping without
foreign aid to raise the siege of the city; but here the
English Government thought it very desirable that some
demonstration should be made. In 1810 the presence of a
British contingent was at length tolerated; and the Artillery

led to their proceeding to that city instead. Their arrival
having been reported, steps were immediately taken by
General Macleod to equip them for service in the field;
and with this view, three batteries of six guns each, with
the necessary equipment, were despatched from England,
and a small supply of horses, seventy-four in number,&mdash;to
form a nucleus of a larger establishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">D.-A.-Gen.

<p>It had been intended that Colonel Framingham should be
the officer to command the Artillery at Cadiz, as soon as the
Spaniards should deign to admit any. Fortunately for Major
Duncan, it was found impossible to spare that officer from
the head-quarters of the army; and at the urgent request of
General Graham, who commanded the English troops at
Cadiz, the command of the Artillery with his force was left
in Major Duncan’s hands, and remained so until 1812, when
he was accidentally killed by the explosion of a powder-mill
at Seville.</p>

<p>In the records already given of the services of the companies
of the 10th Battalion, reference has been made to the
duties of the Royal Artillery at Cadiz. In this chapter it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
is proposed to describe a battle which was fought by General
Graham’s force, and in which,&mdash;it has been said, the Artillery
<span class="sidenote">General
Graham
to Lord
Liverpool,
6 March,
1811.</span>
covered themselves with glory. The gallant General
stated that Artillery had never been better served; but it
may be added that it had never been better handled than
by him. His contingent was but small&mdash;ten guns&mdash;but it
was never idle, and always in the right place. The circumstances
which led to the battle of Barossa may be summarised
as follows:&mdash;An attempt had been resolved upon
by the Anglo-Spanish leaders in Cadiz to raise the French
siege, the opportunity being favourable, as the besieging
force did not at the time exceed 12,000 men. The English
had 4200, and the Spaniards nearly 10,000. To facilitate
matters, General Graham consented to serve under the
Spanish General La Pena, although the event proved that
there never was a man less fitted to hold a command. The
plan of action was to transport the allied force to Tarifa,
disembark there, and effect a junction with another Spanish
force; and then countermarch the whole on the rear of the
besieging force at Chichlana. Inclement weather prevented
the first part of the scheme from being carried out; and the
<span class="sidenote">Cust’s
Annals.</span>
landing was effected, not at Tarifa, but at Algesiras. The
whole army, however, effected a junction at the former place
on the 28th February, 1811, and, driving the French before
them, reached a place known as the Vigia de la Barrosa, or
Barossa, at noon on the 5th March. Here they were encountered
by the French Marshal, Victor, who had been
warned of the expedition, and who promptly availed himself
of the numerous openings which the blunders and incompetency
of the Spanish General offered. The tale of these is
too long to reproduce in a merely Regimental history; suffice
it to say that, owing to them, General Graham found
himself in an extraordinary and embarrassing position.
Having been ordered to march from the height of Barossa,
which was the key of the whole position, and to proceed to
Bermeja through a difficult pine-wood, he obeyed, but with
regret. Assuming that the important point he had just
quitted would be occupied by the Spaniards, he left his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
baggage with a small guard. To his amazement, he soon
learned that no such precaution had been taken; that the
French Marshal, detecting the omission, was already ascending
the height; and that his own baggage-guard was
in extreme and imminent danger. Retracing his steps as
rapidly as the nature of the wood would admit of, he
arrived in time to see the enemy in complete possession of
the height,&mdash;himself face to face with the French, and
utterly unsupported by the Spaniards. By what has been
called by Napier an inspiration&mdash;but such an inspiration as
never comes to the short-sighted or ignorant&mdash;he realised
that retreat would be folly, and that his only hope of success
lay in immediately assuming the offensive. Massing
his Artillery, he desired Major Duncan to keep up a powerful
fire, while he organized his force into divisions for
the attack. Of this fire Napier writes that it ravaged the
French ranks. As soon as the Infantry had formed, General
Graham advanced his Artillery to a more favourable position,
whence, as he afterwards wrote, it kept up a most destructive
fire on the French columns now advancing. The right
division of the English, under General Dilkes, and the left,
under Colonel Wheatley, encountered respectively the French
divisions under Generals Ruffin and Laval. The Infantry
regiments engaged were the Guards, 28th, 7th, 67th, and
87th,&mdash;the flank companies of the 1st Battalion 9th Foot,
2nd Battalion 47th, and 2nd Battalion 82nd, besides part of
the 20th Portuguese Regiment. Where all behaved with
gallantry, it may seem invidious to select any particular
regiment for notice; but, at a most critical moment, the
defeat of General Laval’s division was completed by a
magnificent advance of the 87th Regiment. Both the
French divisions were borne backwards from the hill; and,
uniting, attempted to reform and make another attack. But
their attempt was frustrated by the fire of the Artillery,
which from being terrific, as Napier termed it, became now
<span class="sidenote">Napier,
vol. iii.
p. 446.</span>
“close, rapid, and murderous, and rendered the attempt
vain.” Marshal Victor, therefore, withdrew his troops
from the field, and the English, having been twenty-four
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
hours under arms and without food, were too exhausted to
pursue.</p>

<p>In this battle, which only lasted one hour and a half, over
1200 were killed and wounded on the side of the English,
and more than 2000 on the side of the French. Six guns
and 400 prisoners also fell into the hands of the conquerors.
Of the conduct of his troops generally, General Graham
wrote to Lord Liverpool that nothing less than the almost
unparalleled exertions of every officer, the invincible bravery
of every soldier, and the most determined devotion to the
honour of His Majesty’s arms in all, could have achieved
this brilliant success, against such a formidable enemy so
<span class="sidenote">To Admiral
Sir
C. Cotton,

Cadiz,

posted. Sir Richard Keats, the Admiral on the station, who
had superintended the transport of the troops to Algesiras,
wrote that the British troops, led by their gallant and able
commander,&mdash;forgetting, on the sight of the enemy, their
own fatigue and privations, and regardless of advantage in
the numbers and situation of the enemy,&mdash;gained by their
determined valour a victory uneclipsed by any of the brave
achievements of the British army.</p>

<p>The special expressions used by General Graham in his
despatch with reference to the services of the Royal Artillery
on this occasion are well worthy of a place in the records of
the Corps. “I owe too much,” he wrote, “to Major Duncan
and the officers and corps of the Royal Artillery, not
to mention them in terms of the highest approbation:
<i>never was artillery better served</i>.” He recommended Major
Duncan for promotion, and the brevet rank of Lieutenant-Colonel
was accordingly conferred upon him.</p>

<p>The losses of the Artillery at Barossa were as follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Died of his wounds, Lieutenant Woolcombe.</p>

<p>Wounded: Captains Hughes and Cator,&mdash;Lieutenants
Mitchell, Brereton, Manners, Maitland, and Pester.</p>

<p>Three rank and file killed, and 32 wounded: besides of the
Royal Artillery Drivers, 1 sergeant, 2 rank and file, and 18
horses killed: 1 sergeant, 7 rank and file, and 22 horses
wounded.</p>

<p>The ordnance captured from the French was as follows:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Major
Duncan to
General
Graham.</div>

<p>Two 7-inch howitzers, 3 heavy 8-pounders, 1 4-pounder,&mdash;with
their ammunition waggons, and a proportion of
horses.</p>

<p>The fruits of the battle of Barossa might have been very
considerable, had the Spanish General been capable of understanding
even the rudiments of his profession. As he
was at once ignorant and proud, General Graham found it
necessary to return with his force to Cadiz; the object of
the expedition had failed, for the siege was not raised,&mdash;but
Marshal Victor had received a check which alarmed
him considerably, and which led to eager demands for reinforcements.
In his conduct, both in the action of the 5th
March, and in his withdrawal to Isla de Leon on the following
day, when he separated from the Spaniards, General
Graham received the warmest support from Lord Wellington,
to whose movements the reader is now invited to
return.</p>

<p>After an inactivity of five months before the lines of
Torres Vedras, Massena commenced to evacuate Portugal.
He had no siege artillery with which to attack the fortifications
behind which his enemy was securely sheltered; and
his supplies were becoming every day more difficult to
obtain; he therefore had no other alternative. As he retired,
he was closely followed by the English army, and many
smart affairs took place between the advanced guards of the
latter and the rear-guard of the French army, in which the
Royal Horse Artillery did good service. The limits of the
largest work and the patience of the most enduring reader
would be exhausted were these minor actions given in detail.
Suffice it to say, that the Artillery engaged on these occasions
included the troops commanded by Captain Ross and
Captain Bull,&mdash;that the names of the various actions are
given in the first volume of this history at pages 396 and
401, and that the way in which they performed their duty
may be gathered, in the first place, from Lord Wellington’s
despatches, and, in the second, from the exhaustive narrative
of Napier. In writing of the actions of the 11th, 12th, and
13th March, 1811, at Pombal, Redinha, and Cazal Nova,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
<span class="sidenote">To Lord
Liverpool,
dated

1811.</span>
Lord Wellington said that the troops of Horse Artillery
under Captains Ross and Bull particularly distinguished
themselves. At the affair of Foz d’Arouce, on the 15th
March, he also wrote that the Horse Artillery, under Captains
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
dated
16 March,
1811.</span>
Ross and Bull, distinguished themselves. Later, in
the affair which took place on the 7th April, during a reconnaissance,
in which the English, under Sir W. Erskine,
drove a division of the French army before them across the
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
dated
9 April,
1811.</span>
Turones and Dos Casas, Lord Wellington wrote that “Captain’s
Bull’s troop of Horse Artillery did great execution
on this occasion.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vol. ii.
chap. ii.</div>

<p>At the celebrated engagement of Fuentes d’Onor,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> the
dashing affair mentioned in an early part of this work took
place, in which Captain Norman Ramsay, of Bull’s troop, so
greatly distinguished himself. On this occasion the losses
of the Artillery were as follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Royal Horse Artillery&mdash;1 rank and file and 3 horses killed:
1 rank and file, and 3 horses wounded.</p>

<p>Royal Foot Artillery&mdash;1 sergeant, 4 rank and file, and 9
horses killed; 1 captain, 2 subalterns, 18 rank and file, and
21 horses wounded.</p>

<p>The officers wounded were Captain Thompson,&mdash;whose
brigade did as good service as it had done at Busaco, and
the practice made by which attracted universal admiration,&mdash;Lieutenant
Martin, and a subaltern of the same name as the
officer who fell at Barossa, Lieutenant Woolcombe. The total
casualties on the side of the Allies amounted to 1786: those
of the French to 2665. The battle resulted in the evacuation
of Portugal by Massena, and the capture of Almeida by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
the English, although, unfortunately, not until the garrison
had made its escape.</p>

<p>During these continued successes, Lord Wellington was
afflicted by a want of adequate supplies and money,&mdash;and by
discouraging letters from England. With a temerity such as
few commanders would have displayed, he did not hesitate
to point out to the Government how weak and mistaken
their vacillating, timorous policy was. Still undeceived as
to the worthlessness of Spanish promises, the English rulers
urged upon Wellington to make Spain the theatre of his
operations, and yet declined to make him independent of the
Spanish authorities. His protestations, also, in favour of
Portugal as a base of operations fell on doubting and unwilling
ears. English statesmen seemed to live in a fools’
paradise: and from their dreams it seemed impossible to
<span class="sidenote">To Lord
Liverpool,
dated
Santa
Marinha,
23 March,
1811.</span>
wake them. On the 23rd March, 1811, Lord Wellington
had actually to write, beseeching the Government to forego
an intention which appeared to have been formed of withdrawing
the troops from Portugal on account of the expense
of the war. He had already urged on them the folly of
starving an expedition in the hope of securing popularity
for their party; and he now boldly asserted that if they
carried out their intention, and freed the French from the
pressure of military operations in the Continent, they must
prepare to meet a French army in England. “Then,” he
wrote, “would commence an expensive contest;&mdash;then would
His Majesty’s subjects discover what are the miseries of
war, of which, by the blessing of God, they have hitherto
had no knowledge.” It was a difficult task which Lord
Wellington had to perform,&mdash;not merely to fight his country’s
battles under difficulties and discouragement,&mdash;not merely
to be exasperated by advice, the folly of which was glaring,&mdash;but
also in his few moments of leisure to have to take up
his pen, and teach her senators wisdom. The superiority
of England’s greatest General cannot be realised without a
careful study, not merely of his campaigns, but also of his
correspondence.</p>

<p>It is necessary now to turn to Marshal Beresford’s force,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
with which was Major Dickson, now serving in command
of the Portuguese Artillery. It had been hoped that this
army would reach Badajoz in sufficient time to raise the
French siege of that city; but a slight delay in Beresford’s
movements, combined with undoubted treachery on the
part of the garrison, frustrated this hope, and rendered it
necessary to prepare for a siege of the city with its now
French garrison. From this time, the reader will enjoy an
advantage which cannot be overrated, and which appears
now for the first time in any narrative of the Peninsular War.</p>

<p>Sir Alexander Dickson was not merely a great Artilleryman,
but also a most methodical and industrious collector
and registrar of details which came under his notice. During
the various sieges in the Peninsula which were conducted
by him, he kept diaries mentioning even the most trifling
facts: and on his return to England he procured from
General Macleod the whole of the long series of letters which
he had written to him between 1811 and 1814. The mass of
information which he thus possessed was arranged, and at
his death the whole passed into the hands of his son, Sir Collingwood
Dickson. In the hope that the papers of the most
prominent Artilleryman of the Duke of Wellington’s armies
would be useful in framing a history of the Corps in which
he spent his life, Sir Collingwood kindly placed them at
the disposal of the author of this history. Priceless under
any circumstances, they are even more so from the fact that
several of the letter-books of the Deputy-Adjutant-General’s
department during the Peninsular War have been mislaid;&mdash;and
these refer chiefly to the periods covered by the manuscripts
of Sir Alexander Dickson. On the latter, therefore,
the narrative of the period between 1811 and 1814 will be
chiefly based: and it is hoped that the reproduction of the
opinions and statements of one, so able to express the former
with confidence and the latter with authority, will be a
welcome addition to the literature of England’s wars in the
Peninsula.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span></p>

<p>On the 9th April, 1811, Marshal Beresford advanced from
the Guadiana and invested Olivença. When he reconnoitred
the place, Major Dickson pointed out an inclosed lunette in
front of the gate of San Francisco, from which he knew, by
a former visit to Olivença, that the curtain could be battered
in breach. Approving of the suggestion, Marshal Beresford
despatched Major Dickson to Elvas that night to bring
up the siege artillery. This consisted of six heavy brass
24-pounders, each provided with all necessary stores, and
with ammunition at the rate of 300 rounds per gun. To move
this battery and equipment from Elvas to Olivença 104 pairs
of bullocks were required, and a company of Portuguese Artillery
attended as escort. On the 13th April the guns
arrived at the camp before Olivença, and immediately proceeded
to the neighbourhood of the point of attack. The
breaching battery for four 24-pounders had been got in complete
readiness, and an attempt was accordingly made at
once to put the guns in battery. It was found, however,
impossible to effect this on that day, on account of the
dreadful state of the roads, and the circuit which the guns
were obliged to take. By the night of the 14th, the communications
had been made practicable, and four guns were
placed in the battery, with ammunition and stores, in readiness
to open fire at dawn. Two field batteries of the King’s
German Artillery were also placed so as to keep the enemy’s
fire in check. The field-pieces employed by these were five
6-pounders and one 5½-inch howitzer.</p>

<p>The breaching battery did not open fire until 8 <small>A.M.</small>, on the
15th, the point aimed at being the curtain to the left of the
San Francisco gate, and the distance being about 340 yards.
At 11 <small>A.M.</small> the enemy showed a flag of truce, which occasioned
a cessation of fire; but nothing definite resulting,
it was resumed, and after a few more rounds the enemy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
surrendered at discretion. Major Dickson was much pleased
with the practice made by the young Portuguese Artillerymen
under his command. Only 320 rounds had been fired
in the four hours, and yet the breach was almost practicable.
A brisk fire from five or six guns had been kept up by the
enemy against the breaching battery, and had inflicted some
slight loss; but the field guns of the German Artillery did
much to moderate it, firing about sixty rounds a gun.</p>

<p>On the 17th April, Major Dickson waited on Marshal
Beresford at Zafra, and received orders to proceed to Elvas
to make preparations for the siege of Badajoz. On the 20th
Lord Wellington arrived at Elvas, and issued instructions for
the carrying on of the siege to Marshal Beresford, Colonel
Fletcher of the Engineers, and Major Dickson, the last-named
officer being appointed to direct the Artillery department
of the operation. From the 21st April to the
10th May, the greatest exertions were made, both at Elvas
and around Badajoz, to prepare the necessary ordnance and
stores for the siege, transport them, and make and arm the
batteries. The following shows, in a tabulated form, the

<p>Four brass 12-pounders were at the same time ordered from Elvas to
enfilade the bridge of Badajoz. Four guns for the attack of St. Cristoval
were replaced on the 11th May&mdash;having been damaged&mdash;by three heavy
12-pounders and a field howitzer.</p>

<p>On the 12th May, four 24-pounders were sent from the great park to the
Cristoval attack.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 13th May the siege was ordered to be raised, as
will hereafter be shown.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Badajoz was invested on the right bank on the 8th May,
and on the morning of the 11th the breaching battery
against San Cristoval opened. Being, however, totally unsupported,
and having to resist a very heavy fire from that
fort and the Castle, the young Portuguese Artillerymen
proved unequal to the contest. Their practice, after a few
rounds, became very uncertain; and in the course of the
morning the battery was silenced, all the pieces being disabled
except one howitzer.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span></p>

<p>On the night of the 11th, the battery intended to enfilade
the bridge was armed, and the disabled ordnance in the
breaching battery exchanged. Captain Hawker, commanding
a 9-pounder field brigade of the Royal Artillery, lately
arrived from Lisbon, was directed to place himself under the
orders of Major Dickson, although regimentally senior to
that officer, and was placed in charge of the Artillery operations
against San Cristoval.</p>

<p>The commencement of the siege was very disheartening.
On the day before the solitary battery opened fire, the Allies
had met with a severe loss during a sally made by the garrison;
and now, in a few hours their one battery was silenced. Beresford
was also disquieted by rumours which reached him
that Soult was on his way to raise the siege, and that he would
certainly arrive before the city could be taken. He therefore
sent for Major Dickson late on the night of the 11th,
and desired him not to bring forward any more ammunition
or stores from Elvas, and to be in readiness to remove at the
shortest notice what had already arrived. Colonel Fletcher
also was ordered not to break ground that night against the
Castle. In event, however, of the operations proceeding, it
was arranged that four 24-pounders should be moved from
the south attacks to that of San Cristoval, and that they
should be replaced by six additional guns of the same calibre
from Elvas.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 12th intelligence reached Beresford
which led him to doubt the accuracy of the reports
which had reached him on the previous day, and he ordered
active operations to recommence at once. Additional guns
were therefore sent forward from the park at Elvas, and at
night ground was broken for the batteries against the Castle.
The new activity, however, was but short-lived; for positive
information was received at midnight as to the enemy’s movements.
On the morning of the 13th the siege was ordered
to be raised, and Major Dickson directed to send the heavy
ordnance, ammunition and stores back to Elvas. This duty
was admirably performed. As many pieces of ordnance were
at once despatched, as the means of conveyance would permit;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
and in the first instance it was thought sufficient to
take the pieces across the flying bridge, and to park them in
a situation not visible from Badajoz. On the Cristoval side
the guns were removed from the battery on the night of the
13th; and at the same time the battery in the false attack
against Picurina was dismantled. The 14th May was spent
in carrying away the ordnance and stores in such a way as
to conceal from the enemy the fact that the siege was being
raised; and by noon on the 15th the whole of the besieging
artillery and ammunition from the great park had been
sent across the river, and the flying bridge removed, while
the park of the Cristoval attack had been taken back to
the vicinity of Elvas.</p>

<p>The investing troops on the south bank were then withdrawn;
but a corps remained on the north bank to cover the
removal of the heavy artillery to Elvas. Of the duty performed
by Major Dickson on this occasion, under Marshal
Beresford’s orders, Napier writes that “the arrangements
for carrying off the stores were admirably executed; ...
and that the transactions were so well masked by the 4th
Division, which, in concert with the Spaniards, continued
to maintain the investment, that it was only by a sally on
the rear-guard, in which the Portuguese piquets of the
4th Division were very roughly treated, that the French
knew the siege was raised.”</p>

<p>The same author visits the failure of this siege, and the
heavy losses attending all the subsequent sieges carried on
by the British in Spain, on the absence of any properly-equipped
corps of Sappers and Miners to assist the officers
of Engineers. The want of such a corps, with the necessary
implements, rendered, according to Napier, the British sieges
a mere succession of butcheries. But Sir Alexander Dickson
was ready to accept part of the responsibility of this failure
for his own department. In his diary of the first siege of
<span class="sidenote">Sir A.
Dickson’s
MSS.</span>
Badajoz he wrote: “Every praise was due to the Portuguese
Artillery for the activity, zeal, and willingness they displayed
in this service. Indeed, nothing could exceed their
personal exertions; but, from their professional inexperience,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
Major Dickson has great doubts whether a satisfactory result
would have been obtained without the assistance of a proportion
<span class="sidenote">Dated
Elvas,
22 May,
1811.</span>
of better-trained Artillerymen.” At the same time,
however, he distinctly stated, in a letter to General Macleod,
that his wish was not to begin the fire from any one battery
until the whole attack should be more advanced, and that
the Cristoval attack should be supported from other points.
He added that the battery against the Picurina, although
well placed as an auxiliary for general attack, afforded no
support to that against San Cristoval. In these points, he
wrote, “my opinions coincide entirely with those of Colonel
Fletcher (R.E.), with whom it is a pleasure to serve.”</p>

<p>Marshal Beresford was brave, but was better as an administrator
in peace than as a General in war. No praise can exceed
his deserts in reference to the organization and training of
the Portuguese army, or his fidelity to Wellington; but his
abilities as a commander in the field were feeble, and the success
of his troops in the battle which followed the raising of the
siege of Badajoz was won in spite of, rather than by him.
Albuera was one of the fiercest battles of the Peninsula;
with it the name of Beresford will always be associated; but
its chronicler will always have to register with the stories of
its gallantry that of his incapacity. The policy of fighting
the battle at all&mdash;a question which lies with a General alone&mdash;was
more than doubtful; but, even admitting that it was
wise, his tactics were extremely faulty, and the errors were
expiated only by the courage and losses of his men. With
a General like Soult against him, the arrangement of his
army on the morning of the 16th May revealed a childlike
innocence, which, in a General charged with the lives of
men, was criminal. Part of his army was still at Badajoz,
and could not possibly reach his position in time for the battle;&mdash;part
had barely succeeded in doing so on the eventful
morning;&mdash;he had, on the previous day, allowed the French
to occupy a wood on the other side of the Albuera River,
where they could conceal their intentions;&mdash;and, with marvellous
blindness, he had allowed them to secure a hill in
the immediate front of his own right, behind which they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
organized the famous attack, which so nearly proved
fatal.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 15th, Major Dickson, having completed
his duties at Badajoz, proceeded to Albuera, where
the army had taken up its position, and resumed the command
of his two brigades of Portuguese Field Artillery.
About the same hour on the morning of the 16th as that
on which General Cole’s division happily succeeded in joining
Beresford’s army, the enemy showed himself in force.
The first appearance was the advance of seven or eight
squadrons of cavalry, some light infantry, and a troop of
horse artillery, from the wood towards the bridge of Albuera
by the Seville road. This was a feint, but not immediately
recognized as such by Marshal Beresford. They
drove in the English piquets, and formed in the plain, where
they opened an artillery fire towards the village of Albuera,
a small place, which, with the exception of its church, was
almost in ruins, and which was without inhabitants. This fire
was answered by some of Major Dickson’s and of the German
Artillery, which directed their practice against the cavalry.
At first Major Dickson thought it was merely a reconnoissance;
but it was soon seen that the real attack was intended
against the right, which was composed of Blake’s Spanish
troops. Beresford sent orders to Blake to throw back the
right at right angles to the line; but the command was not
obeyed until he went in person to enforce it, by which time
the French were upon them, harassing them, as they wheeled,
with a murderous fire. From the position occupied by Major
Dickson near the bridge, which was opposite the centre
of the line, he first saw a column of infantry advancing to
the bridge by the same road as had been taken by the
cavalry, on which a brigade of General Stewart’s division
was at once sent to the village to support Baron Alten, who
commanded there. Very soon afterwards, however, he saw
another column moving through the wood in the direction of
the Allied right, and as, at the same time, the column approaching
the bridge first halted, and then commenced to
retire, it was evident that the real French effort would be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
made against the right. Stewart’s British brigade, therefore,
at once marched from the village to the right, followed
by the rest of the division, and Cole’s division formed up
in support.</p>

<p>By this time a heavy shower of rain had commenced,
which greatly favoured the approach of the French columns
against the Spaniards on the right, and during which they
passed the river, and advanced upon and came round the
height which the latter occupied, and on which they were
then, in great confusion, wheeling into a new position. In
describing the conduct of the Spanish troops at Albuera,
Major Dickson, referring to this particular episode in the
<span class="sidenote">To D.-A.-G.
dated
22 May,
1811.</span>
battle, wrote to General Macleod as follows: “The fact is,
the Spaniards, once in line, could not be moved&mdash;I mean,
could not manœuvre&mdash;and the Marshal was obliged to use
the British, that knew how to move, or else our flank
must have been completely turned.”</p>

<p>This quite corroborates Napier’s account of the battle. It
was on the hill occupied by the Spanish that the contest
was decided; it was there that the gallantry of the French
Cavalry and the heroism of the English Infantry were manifested;
there a murderous artillery fire of grape at close
range was maintained incessantly on both sides; and it was
there that the grand final episode took place which was
<span class="sidenote">Napier.</span>
described with poetic fervour by the great historian. “The
Fusileer battalions of Cole’s division advanced in gallant
line, but, struck by the iron tempest, reeled and staggered
like sinking ships. But, suddenly and sternly recovering,
they closed on their terrible enemies; and then was seen
with what a strength and majesty the British soldier
fights.... Nothing could stop that astonishing infantry.
No sudden burst of undisciplined valour, no
nervous enthusiasm, weakened the stability of their order;
their flashing eyes were bent on the dark columns in their
front, their measured tread shook the ground, their dreadful
volleys swept away the head of every formation, their
deafening shouts overpowered the dissonant cries that
broke from all parts of the tumultuous crowd, as, slowly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
and with a horrid carnage, it was pushed by the incessant
vigour of the attack to the farthest edge of the height....
At last the mighty mass gave way, and, like a
loosened cliff, went headlong down the steep. The rain
flowed after in streams discoloured with blood; and
eighteen hundred unwounded men, the remnant of six
thousand unconquerable British soldiers, stood triumphant
on the fatal hill!” Before this final charge took place,
Beresford thought the battle was lost, and commenced
arrangements for a retreat. He ordered the withdrawal
of Alten’s Germans and Major Dickson’s guns from Albuera
bridge. This was strongly asserted by Napier,
although denied by one of his critics; and it is confirmed
<span class="sidenote">To D.-A.-G.
22 May,
1811.</span>
by a passage in one of Major Dickson’s letters. “The Marshal
himself, for a moment, thought he was defeated, as I
received an order to retreat, with my Artillery, towards
Valverde, and Baron Alten absolutely, by order, quitted
the village for a moment. All this was, however, soon
countermanded and rectified.” To Colonel Hardinge was
due the credit of ordering the final and successful advance.</p>

<p>No explanation is given in any of the Regimental records
why Captain Lefebure had only four guns; it may, however,
be assumed that his troop had not yet recovered the drain on
its resources which was made on its arrival in the Peninsula,
when it was called upon to fill up the vacancies in the
Chestnut Troop.</p>

<p>A detailed statement of the services of the Artillery at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
Albuera was forwarded by Major Dickson to General Howorth,
for transmission to England, but, unfortunately, was
lost. The student has, therefore, merely a private letter
from Major Dickson to General Macleod to rely upon, whose
details are, of course, less ample than could be wished. In
it he mentioned that the cannonade on both sides was tremendous
during the whole battle, and that probably on few
such occasions had there been more casualties from artillery
fire. Major Hartmann was in command of the British and
German Artillery; Major Dickson of the Portuguese. These
latter behaved admirably. Captain Lefebure’s troop also
distinguished itself, one gun having been, for a short time,
taken, but afterwards recovered. Captain Hawker’s brigade,
from Major Dickson’s personal observation, did great execution.
General Cole spoke in the highest terms of Captain
Sympher’s brigade; and Captain Cleeve’s guns went through
a number of vicissitudes. Being placed on the hill, where
the great attack was made, the whole of them fell into the
enemy’s hands, but were afterwards recovered, with the exception
of one howitzer. They were admirably served until
the French were actually amongst them; and then retreat was
impossible, the enemy’s cavalry having swept round the hill,
and taken them in rear.</p>

<p>Modern battles may dwarf those of the Peninsula in point
of the numbers engaged; but it is questionable if the British
courage displayed at Albuera, and the proportionate
losses to the number engaged, have ever been surpassed.</p>

<p>The severe fighting lasted about four hours; and in that
time nearly 7000 of the Allies, and over 8000 French, were
killed or wounded. On the side of the Allies, over 4000 of
the casualties were among the British troops, only 1800 of
the total number engaged being untouched. Major Dickson,
in describing the scene, said that every one declared they
had never seen such a field; that on the hill where the great
struggle had been, in the space of from 1000 to 1200 yards,
there were certainly not less than 6000 lying dead or
wounded. Napier’s description of the field after the battle is
characteristically graphic, and leaves an indelible impression
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
on the reader’s mind. Such was the crippled and famished
state of the Allies, that, had the French attacked again
on the 17th, resistance would have been impossible. Fortunately,
Soult resolved to retire; and Lord Wellington, reaching
Albuera on the 19th, sent Beresford to watch his movements,
while he himself proceeded to reinvest Badajoz. The
order issued by Marshal Beresford, after the battle, included
the following paragraph:&mdash;“To Major Hartmann and Major
Dickson, and to the officers and soldiers of the British,
German, and Portuguese Artillery, the greatest praise is
due, and the Marshal returns them his best thanks.” In
<span class="sidenote">To D.-A.-G.
dated
Elvas,
29 May,
1811.</span>
forwarding to the Ordnance a copy of this order, Major
Dickson, with soldierlike generosity, added: “The Marshal’s
orders are not strong enough in favour of the Fusileer
Brigade, who really saved the day.” In Lord Wellington’s
letter to Admiral Berkeley, dated 20th May, 1811, he said
that he considered the battle of Albuera one of the most
glorious and honourable <i>to the character of the troops</i> of any
that had been fought during the war. In Marshal Beresford’s
report to Lord Wellington, dated 18th May, 1811, he said:
“I have every reason to speak favourably of the manner
in which our Artillery was served and fought. Captain
Lefebure’s troop of Horse Artillery did great execution.”</p>

<p>On the 19th May, 1811, Lord Wellington, Colonel
Fletcher, and Major Dickson arrived at Elvas, from Albuera,
to make preparations for resuming the siege of Badajoz.
Colonel Framingham had joined at head-quarters, and assumed
command of the Royal and other Artillery; but Lord
Wellington expressed a wish that Major Dickson should
continue to direct all the arrangements for the siege, and
communicate directly with himself. This distinction caused
no jealousy in Colonel Framingham’s mind; on the other
hand, that officer spoke of Major Dickson to Lord Wellington
in the highest terms, and during the siege assisted him in
every way. This was the beginning of a confidence between
Lord Wellington and Major Dickson, which only increased
as the war went on; and it is interesting to find, even thus
early, the latter officer speak of his great chief as follows:

<span class="sidenote">To D.-A.-G.

“I have transacted business with many Generals, but never
such an one as Lord Wellington, both for general knowledge,
and attention to reason and suggestion.”</p>

<p>The story of the second unsuccessful siege of Badajoz, as
of the first, may be prefaced by showing in a tabular form
some of the more important Artillery statistics connected
with it. These have been extracted from the voluminous
diary and almost daily correspondence of Major Dickson, on
which the summary, given afterwards in the form of narrative,
is also based.</p>

<p>This gave but a very small relief; and Lord Wellington
remarked, after the raising of the siege, that some of the
Royal Artillery were indefatigable, and had never quitted
their batteries.</p>

<p>Captain Latham was the 2nd Captain of Captain Hawker’s
Field Brigade, and was lent for the service of the siege train.
<span class="sidenote">To D.-A.-G.

Of him Major Dickson afterwards said: “I assure you the
assistance I derived from his professional knowledge and
activity can never be forgotten by me.” Instances like
this, and others hereafter to be mentioned, when even
Horse Artillerymen served in the trenches, are arguments
against the necessity of any <i>complete</i> divorce between the
Field and Garrison branches of the Artillery service. Of
Captain Rainsford’s company&mdash;now 7 Battery, 17th Brigade&mdash;Major
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.</span>
Dickson wrote: “It was of wonderful assistance;
it is an uncommon fine one.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">To D.-A.-G.
20 June,
1811.</div>

<p>On the 1st June the batteries on both sides were in a
very forward state, and two on the north side received their
armament. On the south side several guns were brought
into the parallel, ready for mounting on the following night,
when the batteries should be prepared for them. By half-past
8 o’clock on the morning of the 3rd everything was
ready; and on the south side a fire was commenced with
fourteen guns against the point which it was intended to
breach. The fire was most vigorous, and, although well
replied to, gave considerable hopes of success. Two of the
guns became disabled from the effects of their own fire,&mdash;a
casualty whose recurrence during the siege was most monotonous.
On the north side No. 1 Battery was partly employed
to breach San Cristoval, and partly to enfilade the
Castle front; No. 2 to breach San Cristoval; No. 3 against
the defences of the same fort; and No. 4 to keep in check
the tête de pont and enfilade the bridge. The breach in
San Cristoval was begun in the shoulder to the right of the
work, where it formed a dead angle; and in firing at this
from a battery on the north side, a gun, on the very first
night, became disabled by muzzle-drooping. These incidents
will prepare the reader for the verdict of condemnation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
which was unanimously passed on the armament of the
Allied siege trains in the earlier Peninsular sieges.</p>

<p>The howitzers were used as mortars, by taking the wheels
off the carriages and inventing means of elevating them.
Major Dickson had carefully tested what was the extreme
elevation at which they could be used with safety, and found
the <i>maximum</i> was an angle of 30°. Righteous, therefore, was
his indignation when he learnt that, in spite of his own and
Captain Cleeves’ positive orders, an officer on duty on the
north side, whom he tersely stigmatised as “a brute of a Portuguese
Captain,” had thought proper to elevate them to
40° or 42°, with a charge of 2½ lbs. to 3 lbs., the result being
that both carriages were rendered entirely unserviceable,
without any means of replacing them.</p>

<p>On the 4th June, the fire from the south side continued,
but with less effect, the shot entering the wall without
bringing down any part of it worthy of mention. On this
day another gun was disabled at the vent by the effect of its
own fire; and one was rendered unserviceable by that of the
enemy. On the 4th very considerable progress was made
in the breach at San Cristoval. During the night a new
battery was opened in the south attack, and the guns from
No. 1 Battery removed to it.</p>

<p>The 5th of June was a very disheartening day. The progress
in the breach of the south attack was little more hopeful
than on the 4th; and before afternoon the batteries were
reduced&mdash;principally by their own fire&mdash;to nine serviceable
guns. Major Dickson, therefore, proceeded to Lord Wellington,
and obtained his permission to bring six <i>iron</i> 24-pounders
from Elvas to the south attack. The breach in
San Cristoval made by the north attack made apparent progress,
but was not yet deemed practicable. Here, also, one
or two of the guns showed symptoms of giving way.</p>

<p>On the 6th June, Lieutenant Hawker of the Royal Artillery
was killed in the north attack:&mdash;a gallant young
officer, of whom Major Dickson wrote, “He has never been
out of No. 1 Battery from the commencement of the fire.”
In the south attack, a steady fire was kept up from the nine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
serviceable guns during this day, and more progress was made
in breaching the wall, than had been effected during the two
preceding days. Before night, the breach was practicable for
a single person. In the evening, the breach at San Cristoval
was also considered practicable for an assault, which accordingly
was ordered, but repulsed. The enemy had previously
cleared the breach, leaving a certain portion of the wall
standing perpendicular: and their fire was so warm that the
troops could not face it at the breach for any time. Attempts
were made to escalade at one or two other points, but the
ladders were too short; so the party had to retire with a
loss of 130 men.</p>

<p>On the 7th June, another battery of the south attack,
No. 3, was completed; and the iron guns, having arrived
from Elvas, were mounted during the night. The breach on
this side was a little improved, but the resistance of the
wall was far in excess of Major Dickson’s expectations.</p>

<p>On the 8th June, under a fire from 16 24-pounders in
the south attack, the breach on that side seemed large
enough to admit several persons abreast. On the north side,
the fire continued, but the breach was not yet deemed again
practicable. During the night of the 8th, grape-shot was
fired from the south side, but the Portuguese grape was
extremely bad, and the enemy was successful in clearing
away all the rubbish from the breach, in spite of the fire,
leaving to view a considerable height of wall yet uninjured.
A quantity of 3-pounder shot was therefore brought up
from Elvas, which, when tied up in bags containing eight or
ten each, formed a better description of grape. Various
guns in both attacks showed symptoms of distress during
this day.</p>

<p>On the 9th June, there were only twelve or thirteen guns
left serviceable on the south side after the day’s firing,
but the breach was decidedly larger, and grape was fired
all night to prevent the enemy working at it. On the north
side, there were only eight or nine guns left undisabled in
in the evening, but the breach at San Cristoval was pronounced
practicable; and another attempt was made, at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
9 o’clock, to carry it by assault. It was, however, again
repulsed; for it was found that, notwithstanding the appearance
of the breach, there was a perpendicular wall about
6 or 7 feet high still standing, which had been concealed
from view by the counterscarp: and the enemy had taken
every precaution to keep it clear of the <i>débris</i> of the breach.
The gallantry of the assailants was as great, as the defence
<span class="sidenote">Major
Dickson
to D.-A.-G.
26 June,
1811.</span>
of the French was resolute. The ladders were thrown down,&mdash;grenades
thrown among the stormers in great abundance,
and masses of stone hurled down upon them. With the
loss of 150 men, the assailants were obliged to retire.</p>

<p>On the following morning it was found that the grape-shot
from the south attack had been successful in preventing
the enemy from working at the breach, and preparations for
resuming the battering had been ordered, when Major Dickson
received a summons from Lord Wellington. He met him
<span class="sidenote">Dickson’s
MSS.</span>
with Colonel Fletcher on the north side: and they were
informed that he had decided on raising the siege. He
mentioned his reasons; but he particularly pointed out the
impossibility of getting possession of San Cristoval without
advancing to the crest of the <i>glacis</i>;&mdash;the still difficult situation
of the main breach on the south side;&mdash;the imprudence
of attempting it, even when practicable, without first having
Cristoval;&mdash;the strong entrenchments which the enemy had
had time to construct within the breach;&mdash;and finally the approach
of the enemy in such force that prudence would not
allow him to be caught by them in the midst of a siege.
<span class="sidenote">Major
Dickson
to D.-A.-G.c
Elvas,
13 June,
1811.</span>
Soult was at this time in force at Llerena, and Drouet’s
corps was reported as having joined him; while the Northern
French army under Marmont was also in motion.</p>

<p>Major Dickson immediately set to work, and by the evening
of the 12th the whole of the guns, stores, and ammunition
were either in Elvas again, or at such a distance as to be
in perfect safety in all circumstances.</p>

<p>“Thus,” wrote Major Dickson to General Macleod, “ended
this siege, in which everything that artillery could do was
done, considering our miserable means; and this Lord
Wellington was good enough to express, both to Colonel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
Framingham and myself. The brass guns could not stand
the necessary fire, and their destruction, I am of opinion,
was considerably occasioned by the lowness of the shot,
which generally had so much windage that you could put
your fingers in between the shot and the bore....
On the whole I have to observe that our batteries were
too far off.... The whole principle of the attack was
founded on the supposed weakness of the Castle wall, which
it was thought could be beat down at a distance. On
discovering the difficulty of this, the batteries were thrown
forward as far as they could, at the same time avoiding the
fire of the modern fronts, nor could they be advanced
farther until Cristoval was in our hands. Indeed, if that
had been carried, I think we should have got the place....
Lord Wellington was good enough to say that everything
that could be done on our parts, had been done.”</p>

<p>In his despatch to Lord Liverpool, announcing the raising
of the siege, in addition to expressing his great satisfaction
with the Corps, Lord Wellington said that the British service
had derived great advantage in the different operations
against Badajoz from Major Dickson’s zeal, activity, and
intelligence.</p>

<p>The subsequent sieges of Ciudad Rodrigo and of Badajoz,
which took place in 1812, were in marked contrast to those
described in this chapter; and the rapidity with which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
breaches were then made was mainly due to the employment
of iron ordnance from England, instead of the miserable
brass Portuguese guns which were employed in the sieges of
<span class="sidenote">To Lord
Liverpool,
13 June,
1811.</span>
1811.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> Of these guns, Lord Wellington truly said that they
were very ancient and incomplete, and that their fire was
very uncertain. It had at first been intended to fire at the
rate of 120 rounds a gun <i>per diem</i>: but that was soon found
to be impossible with the wretched brass pieces at the disposal
of Major Dickson. It was therefore reduced to 80
rounds; but even with this limited expenditure the guns
were repeatedly disabled by the effect of their own fire.</p>

<p>The Peninsular sieges cannot be thoroughly understood
without two points being borne in mind. First, the besieged
cities belonged to, and were inhabited by, the allies
of England, and the war was only with the garrison. The
Artillery fire, therefore, was confined to breaching, and
dismounting the ordnance in battery,&mdash;not used for bombardment.
Secondly, the sieges were mere episodes in Wellington’s
general operations, not goals to which these operations
tended. Hence, in 1811, the raising of sieges, without
hesitation, after but a brief continuance; and hence, also, in
1812, the rapidity and loss of life with which he stormed
cities, rather than complicate his plans by indulging in
siege operations of a longer and, perhaps, more regular
description.

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> enemy approaching in force, after the raising of the
second siege of Badajoz, the Allies crossed the river on
the 17th June, 1811, and on the 19th encamped between
Elvas and Campo Maior. Elvas had been put in a state of
siege, and a position had been marked out behind Campo
Maior, in case the French should show any inclination to
attack. The bold front which Lord Wellington here showed
deceived the two French Marshals, Marmont and Soult, who
had now united their armies, and entered Badajoz in triumph,
<span class="sidenote">Major
Dickson to
D.-A.-Gen.
dated
26 June,

congratulating its gallant governor, Philippon. They concluded
that he must have received great reinforcements;
and although they crossed the Guadiana with a great body
of cavalry supported with infantry, and one or two small
affairs with the outposts took place,&mdash;they declined a general
engagement. A want of <i>entente cordiale</i> between Marmont
and Soult led soon to a separation,&mdash;the latter moving towards
Seville, whither Wellington despatched Blake’s Spanish
troops,&mdash;and the former marching away by the valley of the
<span class="sidenote">Cust.</span>
Tagus towards Almaraz. Thus relieved of their presence,
Lord Wellington took up his quarters at Pontalegre, and
allowed his army to have some repose after its recent
exertions.</p>

<p>This seems a favourable moment for placing before the
reader a tabular return (<i>see next page</i>) which shows the
gradual increase in the Artillery element of Lord Wellington’s
army in the Peninsula. Prepared from the monthly returns,
it shows the numbers at different periods, distinguishing
between the Royal and Foreign Artilleries. The point which
will doubtless strike the reader most is the steady increase in
the force of Horse Artillery and Artillery drivers, which took
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
place; marking the growing recognition of that which had
hitherto been overlooked to a great extent,&mdash;the value of
mobility in Field Artillery.</p>

<p>General Howorth vacated the command of the Artillery
in the Peninsula in July 1811, being obliged to return to
England on account of ill-health,&mdash;and was shortly afterwards
succeeded by General Borthwick. This officer was
wounded at Ciudad Rodrigo, and returned to England,&mdash;a
coolness having sprung up between him and Lord Wellington,
which recurred with one of his successors, and continued
until the command of the Artillery devolved upon
his favourite, then <i>Colonel</i> Dickson, a few months after the
siege of Burgos.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Major

<p>On the 19th July, 1811, Lord Wellington sent for Colonel
Fletcher, Colonel Framingham, and Major Dickson, and informed
them that it was his intention to attempt the siege
of Ciudad Rodrigo; and after a little conversation as to
the means of transport, &amp;c., he desired Major Dickson to
proceed to Oporto, to superintend the conveyance of the
English battering train up the Douro to Lamego, and thence
by land to Francoso, whence it would also be conveyed by
land to its final destination. This battering train had arrived
in Lisbon in the first instance, and had been carried
secretly to Oporto, with a view to the proposed siege of
Ciudad Rodrigo, its ostensible destination being Cadiz.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
Two new companies of Artillery which had arrived in
Lisbon were now ordered to Oporto to assist Major Dickson.
In all these arrangements Lord Wellington underrated the
strength of the French army in the north of the Peninsula.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To D.-A.-G.

<p>Major Dickson reached Almeida, on his way to Oporto,
on the 28th July, and arrived at the latter place on the
3rd August, where he found Captain Bredin’s and Captain
Glubb’s companies&mdash;now H Battery, 1st Brigade, and 5 Battery
5th Brigade&mdash;waiting his orders. Before the 13th the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
whole of the train had been embarked in boats, about 160 in
number, and despatched to Lamego; but the work and the
climate proved too much for Major Dickson, and before he
could follow the train he was struck down with a violent
fever, accompanied by delirium. When first attacked, he
requested Lord Wellington to send some one to take up
his duties, and, accordingly, his friend Captain May was
sent, and superintended the movement of the train until the
5th September, when the gallant Dickson, only half recovered,
and travelling in a litter, arrived at Lamego. Here
he found that all the guns and stores had marched for Villa
da Ponte, and that Captain May was on the point of following
<span class="sidenote">Major
Dickson to
D.-A.-Gen.
dated
Villa da
Ponte,

1811.</span>
them. On the 8th Major Dickson left Lamego, and
reached Villa da Ponte on the 10th, where he fell an immediate
victim to a relapse of fever, which lasted acutely
several days. Captain Bredin’s company had, in the meantime,
been recalled to the head-quarters of the army, to take
over the brigade of guns from Captain Thompson’s, which was
almost <i>hors de combat</i> from sickness.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> The troops left with
the battering train were therefore reduced to Captain Glubb’s
company of Royal Artillery, about 250 Portuguese Artillery,
and from 1200 to 1400 Portuguese Militia, intended to assist
on the march. Captain Holcombe’s company of Royal
Artillery was hourly expected. That company is now No. 4
Battery 2nd Brigade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ibid.
20 Sept.
1811.</div>

<p>On the march, the battering train had been arranged by
Captain May as follows. It was divided, as far as the ordnance
was concerned, into five divisions; each gun marched
with 350 rounds, and each howitzer and mortar with 160
rounds. An officer was placed in charge of each division,
and each division marched separately. The remaining stores
and ammunition requisite to furnish a total of 800 rounds
per gun, and 400 for each howitzer and mortar, were under
the charge of the Commissary and other officers, and marched
in rear.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span></p>

<p>While at Villa da Ponte, awaiting orders from Lord Wellington
for a further advance, Major Dickson’s correspondence
was of a nature which reveals to the reader more of the
personal element than his letters, as a rule, allow to become
visible. The alternate hoping and despairing as to orders
for advance,&mdash;the <i>ennui</i> produced by enforced idleness,&mdash;the
impetuous way in which he would fling himself into
professional discussions with General Macleod, merely to
occupy his leisure,&mdash;the spasmodic fits of zeal in improving
the arrangement of the immense train,&mdash;all unite to present
to the reader a very vivid picture of him whose hand, so
long still, penned these faded letters. His recurring attacks
of fever&mdash;followed by apologies like the following: “The
fact is, when I am well I forget all, take violent exercise
at all times and seasons, and knock myself up; but I am
determined to be more careful in future”&mdash;followed by an
inevitable relapse, in proof of the failure of his good resolutions,&mdash;combine
to bring before the reader a very lovable
picture of a very earnest man. It is by such study alone
that the Artilleryman can realise the characters of the great
among his predecessors in the Corps, and by such links that
he can bind them to himself with that almost family tie, of
which the Regimental union is but an expansion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To D.-A.-G.
dated

<p>The extent of the battering train under Major Dickson’s
command was as follows:&mdash;34 24-pounders, 4 18-pounders,
16 iron 5½-inch howitzers, 2 8-inch howitzers, and 8 10-inch
mortars; and much of his leisure at Villa da Ponte was
devoted to improving and renewing the somewhat shattered
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.

carriages of this ordnance. On the 16th November he received
an order from Lord Wellington to commence moving
the battering train to Almeida; and by the 21st the last
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.

division, spare carriages, &amp;c., had left. The march was
most successful. No fewer than 1100 bullocks were employed
for the divisions alone, apart from the reserve of
stores; and in no case did the march occupy more than six
days, although the country was very mountainous; nor did
a single accident occur. The bringing up the reserve of
ammunition and stores was delayed by want of means
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
of conveyance; and pending its arrival, Lord Wellington
requested Major Dickson to superintend the unspiking of
the ordnance in Almeida, and the placing the batteries
in a state of defence. In this occupation the reader is
requested to leave him while he returns to the movements
of Lord Wellington, which were now assuming an active
form.</p>

<p>The English General had moved northward, with the
view of besieging Ciudad Rodrigo; and a summary of his
movements may be given from some admirable MS. letters,
written by Captain May on his return to the head-quarters
of the army. On the 23rd September the enemy’s
advanced guard was near Ciudad Rodrigo. The French
army was under Marmont and Dorsenne, and numbered
60,000  men, including 6000 cavalry. On the 24th, the whole
of this cavalry had crossed the Agueda, about 10,000 infantry
remaining on the other side. On the 25th the enemy
advanced, and Wellington disputed the ground, retiring
gradually to the position at Fuente de Guinaldo. In this
advance the enemy’s cavalry and artillery were principally
engaged; and on the side of the Allies, the Cavalry, Portuguese
Artillery, and Cole’s and Picton’s divisions of Infantry.
During this forward movement the enemy, by a charge of
cavalry, gained possession of five Portuguese guns, which,
however, were speedily recaptured by the 5th Regiment of
Foot, in a most gallant and intrepid manner. On the 26th,
the Allies remained all day in the position of Guinaldo,
which extended from the right and front of the town for
four miles towards Ituero, the woods being occupied by two
Infantry brigades from the right down to the Agueda. Thus
posted, they witnessed the arrival of the whole French army,
the last of which did not arrive until sunset. On satisfying
himself as to their numbers, and bearing in mind the great
extent of country to be watched, Lord Wellington determined
to retire in the evening to a more favourable position
for concentration and battle. The army, therefore, began its
march to the rear at 10 <small>P.M.</small>, and next day, the 27th, everything
was in the neighbourhood of the new position, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
occupied a length of about six miles. The left was near
Reudon, on the Coa, and the right in the rear of Çouta,
resting on the mountains. When daylight revealed to the
enemy the masterly retreat which had taken place, some
cavalry and infantry were pressed forward, and the Allied
piquets were driven in; but Wellington, suddenly assuming
the offensive, drove them back from Alfaites to Aldea da
Ponte, his troops occupying the latter village. After sunset,
however, the enemy advanced in such force, in front and
also on the flanks of the village, that the officer commanding
there wisely withdrew his troops to Alfaites. This
final advance of the French was made to cover a retreat
which had now been determined on. On the morning of the
28th nothing could be seen of them; and on the 29th it
was learnt that they were moving back on Ciudad Rodrigo.
After they had thrown provisions into that city, they continued
to retire, and went into cantonments in the neighbourhood
of Salamanca. The British army did the same
between the Coa and the Agueda, Lord Wellington, with his
head-quarters at Freneda, keeping watch on the city which
he had determined to take.</p>

<p>The only brilliant affair which took place between this
time and the successful sieges, which will now have to be
mentioned, was the surprise of Girard’s division by General
Hill, at Arroyo de Molinos. As, however, the Artillery with
Hill’s force was Portuguese,&mdash;Major Hawker’s 9-pounder brigade
of Royal Artillery having been unable to get up on
account of the state of the roads,&mdash;its further notice in this
work will be unnecessary.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the French troops being scattered in
their cantonments, and having ascertained that large reinforcements
from Marmont’s army had been detached to
Valencia, Lord Wellington resolved on a short, sharp siege
of Ciudad Rodrigo. In the end of December he sent for
<span class="sidenote">Major
Dickson to
D.-A.-Gen.
1 Jan.
1812.</span>
Major Dickson, and directed him to move forward the battering
train and stores from Almeida, Galegos being made
the intermediate depôt. To the latter place the army
head-quarters were moved on the 7th July.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span></p>

<p>The main interest to the military reader in the sieges of
Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz, in 1812, attaches to the gallantry
of the Infantry. The monotonous, albeit shortlived,
work in the batteries is drowned in the recollection of the
scenes of valour at the final assault. In these pages, therefore,
the Artillery share in the sieges will assume, of necessity,
the form of a few dry statistics.</p>

<p>The Artillery present at the siege included 185 of the
Royal Artillery and 370 of the Portuguese. The names of
the officers of the Royal Artillery who were present were
General Borthwick, Major Dickson, Captains Holcombe,
Thompson, Power, Dundas, and Dyneley; Lieutenants
Bourchier, Love, Johnstone, Ingilby, Smith, and Grimes;
and Captain May, Brigade-Major.</p>

<p>The batteries opened in the afternoon of the 14th January,
1812, the guns having narrowly escaped being spiked in
the morning of that day. On the night of the 19th, the
breaches were pronounced practicable, and Wellington announced
in orders, “Ciudad Rodrigo <i>must</i> be stormed this
evening.” Except on the 16th and part of the 17th, the
weather was clear and admirably suited for artillery practice,
and the batteries were in action daily for an average of
eight and a half hours.</p>

<p>The guns employed were as follows:&mdash;On January 14th,
20 24-pounders and 2 18-pounders; on January 15th, 23
24-pounders and 2 18-pounders; on January 16th and 17th,
the same; on January 18th, 30 24-pounders and 2 18-pounders;
and on January 19, 30 24-pounders.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>The expenditure of ammunition during this short siege
was as follows,&mdash;the total number of guns in battery having
been 34 24-pounders, and 4 18-pounders<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span></p>

<p>The absence of mortars and howitzers from this siege was
explained by the increased amount of transport required for
shell, compared with shot, and by the fact that Lord Wellington
had resolved on an assault the moment a breach was
practicable, without any other siege operations. Shot were,
therefore, all that was necessary, except for keeping the
enemy from working at the breach.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To D.-A.-G.

<p>The following extract from a letter written by Major
Dickson after the siege, is interesting:&mdash;“Lord Wellington
has certainly made a most brilliant <i>coup</i>, and, I am convinced,
astonished the enemy by the rapidity of his operations.
They intended to relieve the place and raise the
siege about this day (29th January). We were certainly
favoured by the most delightful weather&mdash;excessively cold,
but perfectly dry. It was not even necessary to put the
powder under the laboratory tents, which I was enabled
to spare to keep the poor fellows from the pinching frost;
for we were nearly without cover.... I am hard
pressed for time, but I must say a word in favour of our
fine fellows of the Corps. They were (Portuguese and all)
at relief and relief, off and on; but nothing could exceed
their zeal and activity, and their work speaks for itself.
<i>Never was better practice made.</i> I had only 430 Artillerymen
of both nations,&mdash;about 130 British, and the rest
Portuguese. We had somewhere more than 50 Artillerymen
killed and wounded, but no officer materially hurt.
The latter days, to make it up, I had some help from our
own field Artillery:&mdash;part of Lawson’s company was one
day in the trenches, and part of Sympher’s German company
another.”</p>

<p>The actual number of killed and wounded between the

<div class="sidenote">To Lord

<p>In Lord Wellington’s despatch, announcing the successful
termination of the siege, he&mdash;after extolling Major Dickson’s
conduct of the Artillery operations&mdash;proceeded to say:
“The rapid execution produced by the well-directed fire
kept up from our batteries affords the best proof of the
merits of the officers and men of the Royal Artillery, and
of the Portuguese Artillery, employed on this occasion;
but I must particularly mention Brigade-Major May, and
Captains Holcombe, Power, Dyneley, and Dundas, of the
Royal Artillery.”</p>

<p>General Borthwick’s name is not mentioned, either in the
despatch or among the wounded; but he appears in Kane’s
list&mdash;generally most accurate in its details&mdash;as having been
in command of the Artillery, and also as having been
wounded, during the siege.</p>

<p>Ciudad Rodrigo had hardly fallen, before Lord Wellington
resolved to attempt a third siege of Badajoz,&mdash;now that he
had suitable ordnance. He ordered Major Dickson to proceed
on the 30th January to Setubal, calling at Elvas to
make some necessary arrangements. From Setubal he was
directed to send 16 24-pounders of a new battering train,
which had arrived, to Elvas,&mdash;as well as 20 guns of the same
calibre, which were to be furnished from the navy. The
whole of these guns were to travel on block carriages. The
difficulty of sending the heavy guns of the train at Almeida
to Elvas led to this arrangement: but it was decided to
send the 24-pounder howitzers, as being much lighter, and
also a number of 24-pounder carriages, which were stored at
Almeida. By this means it was hoped to have speedily
equipped at Elvas a new battering train of 36 iron 24-pounder
guns, and 16 24-pounder howitzers,&mdash;an armament
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
very different from the brass Portuguese guns which had
assailed the stronghold of Philippon twice before.</p>

<p>So incessant was the work which now devolved on Major
Dickson that he had no time for correspondence, and there is
a great blank, where the student had hoped to find much
that was interesting. From other sources, therefore, the
Artillery details of a siege, which can never be forgotten,
must be procured. As at Ciudad Rodrigo, the Infantry
share in the operations dwarfs all other;&mdash;but it dwarfs
it to even a greater extent. The story of the storming of
Badajoz is one which will thrill the heart of every Briton
for all time; which will bind together by sacred memories
the regiments which were so nobly represented on that
day; and which will impress on all, who study it, the truth
of Napier’s words, that “a British army bears with it an
awful power.” The scene on the night of the 6th April,
1812, was one before which the energy, zeal, and proficiency
of the Artillery on the preceding days pale away into
nothingness; and the chronicling of their humble statistics
seems almost an impertinence. For, the night of the 6th
<span class="sidenote">Napier.</span>
was, indeed, one in which “many died, and there was much
glory;” it was one in which death took many and hideous
forms,&mdash;“the slain dying not all suddenly, nor by one
manner of death; some perishing by steel, some by shot,
some by water, some crushed and mangled by heavy
weights, some trampled upon, some dashed to atoms by
fiery explosions;” and yet it was a night in which the most
cruel death was fair to look on,&mdash;because hallowed by marvellous
courage and rare devotion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tables
published
by an

<p>The breaches, which were rendered famous by this combat
“so fiercely fought, so terribly won,” were virtually made
between the 30th March and the 6th April. On the 30th
March 8 18-pounders were in action for purely breaching
purposes; on the following day, this number was increased,
by 12 24-pounders, and 6 18-pounders, to 26 guns; and
these remained in action, for 13 hours a day, until the
storming of the place. Of round shot, alone, no fewer than
18,832 24-pr., and 13,029 18-pr., were expended during the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
short siege; besides 1163 24-pounder grape shot, and 496 of
the same from the 18-pounders. Of the round shot, 23,896
were employed in forming the three breaches. Besides the
breaching guns, there were 10 24-pounder and 18-pounder
guns, and 16 5½-inch howitzers, employed for enfilading and
other fire. From the last mentioned, 507 common shell and
1319 spherical case were fired during the siege.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tables
published
by an
officer
of Artillery
in 1819.</div>

<p>The three breaches were rendered practicable from a distance
of between 600 and 700 yards; and the curtain breach
was made in one day, the day of the assault. To the rapidity
of the making of this breach was much of the success
in the final storming due; because, had several days been
required, measures would have been adopted by the defenders
during the intervening nights to render it wholly impracticable.
In making this curtain breach, 14 guns were
employed, with an expenditure of 3514 rounds.</p>

<p>Colonel Framingham commanded the Allied Artillery
during the siege, but Major Dickson virtually directed the
operations. From a rough MS. diary in the Record Office,
in the handwriting of the latter officer, it would appear
that the strength of the Artillery was as follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In his despatch, after the storming of the city, Lord
Wellington said: “Major Dickson conducted the details of
the Artillery service during this siege, as well as upon
former occasions, under the general superintendence
of Lieut.-Colonel Framingham, who, since the absence of
Major-General Borthwick, has commanded the Artillery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
with this army. I cannot sufficiently applaud the officers
and soldiers of the British and Portuguese Artillery during
this siege, particularly Lieut.-Colonel Robe, who opened
the breaching batteries, Majors May and Holcombe,
Captain Gardiner and Lieutenant Bourchier, of the Royal
Artillery; Captain de Rettberg, of the King’s German
Artillery; and Major Tulloh, of the Portuguese. Adverting
to the extent of the details of the Ordnance Department
during this siege, to the difficulty of weather, &amp;c.,
with which Major Dickson had to contend, I must mention
him most particularly to your Lordship.” Besides the
officers named in the despatch, there were present in the
batteries Captains Power, Latham, Dundas, and Dansey;
and Lieutenants Weston, Connel, Grimes, and Love.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Killed: Captain Latham, Lieutenant Connel, and 23 non-commissioned officers and men.<br /></span>

<span class="sidenote">Major Ross

out by Major Dickson for duty in the trenches, it is evident
that they must have taken part in the operations, for Major
Ross was severely wounded by a grape-shot. But his name
does not appear in Lord Wellington’s lists.</p>

<p>The losses in the other arms of the service employed in
the siege were very great. No fewer than 5000 officers and
men fell during the siege, and of that number 3500 fell on
the night of the 6th April. Sixty officers and upwards of
seven hundred men were slain on the spot.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span></p>

<p>No wonder that, “when the extent of the night’s havoc
was made known to Lord Wellington, the firmness of his
nature gave way for a moment, and the pride of conquest
yielded to a passionate burst of grief for the loss of his
gallant soldiers.”</p>

<p>The recollections of such a night are among the greatest
treasures which an army can cherish. Even the reaction
after success, the irregularities and licence displayed by
the troops in the captured city, while certainly dimming,
could not permanently injure the glory of the marvellous
assault. Such traditions are a weapon for discipline, which
only a soldier can estimate. Inspired by them, men will
feed the lamp of their present lives with the oil of past
glory, and strain every nerve to make the flame burn pure
and clear.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the highest motives, which can influence a
soldier, is the desire to be worthy of his predecessors, and
true to the reputation which they have earned for their
corps. It carries him at once out of himself, and introduces
an unselfish element even into his own ambition and aims.
Only those who have served long in a regiment which they
love can understand the fond jealousy for its honour, which
will inspire its members. Its history never dies; the deeds
of the years that are gone are the living possession of all;
the valour which may have been exhibited in former days
lives again in the breasts of those, who hunger for an opportunity
of similar display; and the men who, by their
courage and skill, may have earned honour for their corps,
still haunt in no shadowy form the dreams of the young
aspirant, and the memories of the old.</p>

<p>The year 1812 was the most eventful in the Peninsular
War. Already marked by the successful sieges described in
the last chapter, it was to be distinguished by events, both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
in Spain and elsewhere, which were to have a great effect
on subsequent hostilities. The English General&mdash;who
opened the year with an unexpected attack on Ciudad
Rodrigo&mdash;was destined, ere it should be much more than
half over, to defeat his enemy in a pitched battle, drive him
ignominiously before him, and enter the capital of Spain in
triumph. These successes were to be further heightened by
Soult raising the long-continued siege of Cadiz, in alarm
at the intelligence of the French disasters in the north.
Scarcely, however, were these advantages to be realised, ere
the whole picture should change. The conqueror at Ciudad
Rodrigo and Badajoz should find himself fretting hopelessly
before the castle of Burgos; and the General, who entered
Madrid in triumph at the head of a victorious army, should
lead that same army&mdash;in disorder and semi-mutiny&mdash;from
Salamanca to Portugal, in retreat. The light and shade in
the military operations of the Peninsula were also to be
intensified by news from without, which should mightily
affect the powers whose armies had faced one another for
so many years. Another war should be thrust upon England’s
preoccupied people;&mdash;her own children in America
should seize the opportunity of gratifying a seemingly undying
jealousy;&mdash;while, away in the colds of Russia, the
greatest army that even Napoleon had ever commanded,
should dissolve, as utterly as the snows amid which they
died should melt before the strengthening sun.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a year of great events: but of these the
two with which this history has most interest were the
battle of Salamanca and the siege of Burgos.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Colonel
Dickson to
D.-A.-Gen.
dated
Orbada,
30 June,
1812.</div>

<p>Colonel Dickson, with the brigade of howitzers which he
had commanded at Almaraz, left Elvas on the 5th June to
join Lord Wellington’s army in the north. Passing the
Tagus at Alcantara, he joined the army at Salamanca by
way of Zarza, Fuente Guinalda, and Ciudad Rodrigo. Wellington
was engaged at this time, with very limited means,
in endeavouring to reduce the French Fort St. Vincent at
Salamanca, a strongly entrenched work, having a large
convent as its stronghold, and mounted with 36 pieces of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
ordnance. The Allied siege Artillery&mdash;previous to Colonel
Dickson’s arrival&mdash;consisted of only 4 18-pounder guns, and
a battery of long 6-pounders, under Lieut.-Colonel May.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
That officer had performed his duty, with inadequate means,
in a manner which called forth universal admiration; and
Colonel Dickson when he arrived with his howitzers to assist
him, expressed the great satisfaction it afforded him to be
able now to repay, in a small degree, the many acts of kindness
and co-operation, which he had enjoyed at Colonel May’s
hands. Several points of the defence were breached by the
fire of the Allied Artillery, but the whole work was so
strong, and the defences so connected, that no assault could
be attempted on the body of the work. An assault made
on two outworks failed at first, but the gorge of one of them
having been subsequently breached, they were carried with
little or no loss a few hours before the surrender of the
chief fort. The means at their disposal being very small,
Colonels May and Dickson employed hot shot from the
howitzers against the Convent, and succeeded, after firing
260 rounds, in setting fire to it, and destroying the whole
of the enemy’s provisions. The surrender followed almost
<span class="sidenote">Despatch
dated
Fuente la
Pena,
30 June,
1812.</span>
immediately. These operations had been mainly conducted
by General Clinton, under the supervision of Lord Wellington;
and, in his despatch, Lord Wellington reported that that
officer had mentioned in strong terms Lieut.-Colonel May,
who commanded the Royal Artillery under the direction of
Colonel Framingham, and the officers and men under his
command. The capture of the forts was delayed until the
27th June, it having been necessary to send to the rear for
more ammunition, a step which caused a delay of six days.
As soon as they fell, the French army commenced to retire,
pursued by the Allies.</p>

<p>The loss of the Royal Artillery at the siege of these forts
was as follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Killed: Captain Eligé, and 9 rank and file.</p>

<p>Wounded: 1 lieutenant (Love), and 25 rank and file.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span></p>

<p>In the various movements of both armies between the
27th June and the 22nd July, 1812, on which day the great
engagement known as the battle of Salamanca was fought,
no use appears to have been made of the Artillery, with the
exception of the Horse Artillery attached to the Cavalry
division. In one affair, on the 18th July, at Castrejou,
when the troops under Sir Stapleton Cotton were attacked,
Lieutenant Belson, an officer in the Chestnut Troop, was
wounded. For honest, conscientious hard work, and staunch
performance of his duty, this officer was unsurpassed by
any in the Regiment. On reference to his record of
service, it appears that between the 3rd August, 1809, and
14th April, 1814, Lieutenant Belson was present in no
fewer than thirty-three engagements. Beside such services,
which received but little official recognition, those of men in
more recent campaigns, who have received lavish, although
merited, rewards, sink into insignificance.</p>

<p>It is impossible, without exceeding the limits of this
work, to describe in detail the services of the Horse
Artillery in the Peninsula,&mdash;the branch of the regiment to
which young Belson belonged. The tables at the end of
the preceding volume give some idea of what these services
were, but are totally inadequate. The history of some of
the individual troops would alone fill a volume; and the
writing of such a history will doubtless be undertaken by
some officer, who may find himself in the proud position of
commanding one. Their active duties were incessant; even
during the sieges, when they ostensibly formed part of the
armies of investment or observation, they were ready to
volunteer at all times to do additional duty in the trenches.
At San Sebastian, as will be seen shortly, their services in
the sieges, as siege artillerymen, were invaluable. The
details of their services in the great battle now to be
described are, unfortunately, not given in any of the documents
in the Record Office. The fact of the presence of
three troops, Ross’s, Bull’s, and Macdonald’s, is known, but
little more. They were included in the general mention of
the Corps, by Lord Wellington, after the battle, when he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
<span class="sidenote">Despatch
dated
Flores de
Avila,
24 July,
1812.</span>
said that “The Royal and German Artillery under Lieutenant-Colonel
Framingham distinguished themselves by
the accuracy of their fire;” but no further details are
given. From another pen we learn that the whole of the
<span class="sidenote">Browne.</span>
troops and batteries were more or less engaged during the
eventful day; but this general statement is neither satisfying,
nor quite exact. In a letter from Colonel Dickson,
written three days after the battle, he mentions that one of
his heavy brigades was not ordered up, but was kept in the
rear, ready to move in case of retreat. Possibly this brigade
may have been manned by Portuguese, and the howitzer
brigade, which he commanded during the battle, may have
been manned by Captain Glubb’s company, which was under
his orders;&mdash;in which case the author referred to would be
right; but it is extremely rare in Colonel Dickson’s correspondence
to find him alluding to any action, in which he
commanded men of his own Corps, without particularizing
some by name. On the other hand, it must be admitted
that Napier describes Colonel Dickson’s howitzers as being
manned by British and Portuguese brigaded together.</p>

<p>Lord Wellington’s letters show that he was by no means
anxious for a general action at this time, if it could have
been avoided; and this fact was apparent to those around
him. When it was inevitable, he found that the enemy
had a better position than himself; and but for the unexpected
<span class="sidenote">To D.-A.-G.
dated
25 July,
1812.</span>
opening given by Marmont, in the over extension of
his left, it would have been a very doubtful issue. “I
really believe,” wrote Colonel Dickson, “that Lord
Wellington fought against his inclination, and that if
Marmont by his manœuvres had not pushed him so hard,
he would quietly have fallen back, and relinquished
Salamanca to the French. The audacity of the enemy
was such, however, that British honour required it should
be checked; and most severely Marshal Marmont has
been punished for playing tricks with such a leader as
Lord Wellington. When at last his Lordship determined
to attack the attacker, his dispositions were splendid, and
his operations rapid and overpowering. I can compare
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
the close-fighting part of the battle more to one of those
battles between the French and Spaniards, of which there
have been so many, with always the same result, than to a
contest between armies equally powerful. It was a rapid
succession of overthrows, with some failures, but none
that for a moment impeded the grand result.”</p>

<p>There were two hills on the left of the Allied line, called
Dos Arapiles or Los Hermanitos, situated within easy
artillery range of one another. The French had obtained
possession of the loftier of these, and by this means had
acquired an undoubted advantage. But this advantage was
modified by the artillery fire on the left of Lord Wellington’s
line, which was very effective. It was here that Colonel
Dickson’s howitzer brigade was in action, taking part in an
Artillery duel, which is mentioned in the correspondence of
<span class="sidenote">To Colonel
Shrapnel,
dated
9 May,
1813.</span>
several Artillery officers who took part in it. Major Macdonald,
who commanded a troop of Horse Artillery on the
occasion, said that the French artillerymen were driven
from their guns on the hill opposite, and prevented from
returning, by the destructive fire of Shrapnel shell from the
<span class="sidenote">Lieut.
Sinclair,
R.A., to
Colonel
Shrapnel,
dated
22 Oct.
1814.</span>
English guns. In another letter, from an officer who was
also present, the same statement is endorsed; and the
reader learns that the brigades of Artillery chiefly engaged
were Ross’s, Bull’s, and Macdonald’s troops, Colonel Dickson’s
and Captain Douglas’s brigades, and Major Sympher’s of
the King’s German Artillery. From the same sources it is
ascertained that in the staunch final advance of the enemy
against the village of the Arapiles, the fire of Shrapnel shell
from the howitzers of the English Artillery produced great
effect; and that, on another important occasion during the
battle, a battery of the enemy’s guns was disabled by the
same means. It will be in the recollection of the military
student that Marmont’s extension and weakening of his left
sprang from a desire to cut off the retreat of the Allies on
Ciudad Rodrigo, while he should yet retain the strong position
on his right, afforded by the possession of the hill already
mentioned. The division Thomières was selected for the
flank movement, and against it Pakenham’s division was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
despatched by Lord Wellington, accompanied by 12 guns.
The service performed by these guns was most valuable.
Being placed in a commanding position, they suddenly took
the French troops in flank, and aided materially in ensuring
a victory, which Lord Wellington’s quick judgment and
military skill had placed in the way of his troops. Then
followed the stern battle all along the line, which resulted
in the “beating of forty thousand men in forty minutes;”
the French seeing General after General fall, and fighting
at times in bewilderment, for want of orders;&mdash;the English
fighting with all the courage of their race, and all the
confidence which a General like Wellington inspired,&mdash;who
seemed to be always at the right place at the right time:&mdash;then
the French falling back from their first position only
to make a new effort; and then the utter rout and confusion,
redeemed but by the coolness and skill of the brave Foy,
who with his rear-guard strove to cover the headlong flight
of the others.</p>

<p>The strength of the Allied army at Salamanca was 46,000,
that of the French 42,000; but the superiority in point of
numbers on the side of the Allies was caused by the presence
of some utterly useless Spanish troops. The French had
74 guns on the field, the Allies only 60. These, according to
Napier, were as follows:-</p>

<p>There would certainly appear to be an error in this
statement. In none of Colonel Dickson’s manuscripts can it
be traced that there were more than five 24-pounder
howitzers with his brigades; it would therefore seem that
the strength of the Allied Artillery at Salamanca was even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
more disproportionate than that given, and that Lord
Wellington had only 59 guns against Marmont’s 74.</p>

<p>The losses on both sides at Salamanca were very heavy.
The Allies lost 1 General, 24 officers, and 686 men killed;
and 5 Generals, 182 officers, and 4270 men wounded. The
loss of the French has never been exactly stated. They
lost 7000 prisoners alone, besides 11 guns and other
<span class="sidenote">Cust’s
‘Annals of
the Wars.’</span>
trophies. An approximation to their real loss has been
obtained by taking General Clausel’s statement of the army
on the 18th of the following month. He had succeeded
Marshal Marmont in the command, on the latter being
wounded; and on the 18th August he reported that the
army, which had been 42,000 strong on the 22nd July, had
fallen to 21,800, with 50 instead of 74 guns. Much of the
loss may have occurred during the pursuit after the battle,
but the whole was virtually attributable to the contest of
the 22nd.</p>

<p>Important as the results of the victory were, they would
have been more so, had not the retreat of the French across
the Tormes been facilitated by a blunder of the Spanish
General, Espana, who left the bridge of Alba open to them.
This enabled Clausel to get as far as Peneranda with far less
punishment than an army so beaten as his was should have
received from his pursuers.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> Wellington followed him to
Valladolid, but failed to overtake him; so, while Clausel
continued his flight to Burgos, Wellington, after a pause of
some days, turned towards Madrid, to free the capital from
the presence of Joseph Buonaparte and his army.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
entered it in state on the 12th August, Joseph having
quitted it without waiting for the Allies; and he remained
there until the 1st September, receiving from the Spaniards
a perpetual ovation, and learning from England how
valuable his services were deemed, by their further recognition
in the form of a Marquisate.</p>

<p>Affairs in the Peninsula forbade longer repose, nor was
Wellington the man to risk his army finding a Capua in
Madrid. Soult, alarmed at the news from the north, raised
the siege of Cadiz, and let Seville fall into the hands of the
Allies, while he moved northward himself. An expedition from
Sicily landed in the east of Spain, to co-operate with Lord
Wellington, of which it must suffice here to say that the
Royal Artillery accompanying it was commanded by Captain&mdash;then
Brevet Lieut.-Colonel&mdash;Holcombe, the same
officer whose company had been at the sieges of Ciudad
Rodrigo and Badajoz. And, lastly, the French General,
Clausel, had reorganized his army, and was taking the
offensive against the Allied troops left in the north. Of the
operations of Wellington to check this General, and to
defeat him again before Soult’s army could join him from
the south, it is proposed to select one, as being a specially
Artillery subject&mdash;the siege of the Castle of Burgos.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dickson’s
MSS.</div>

<p>After the fall of the forts at Salamanca, the heavy
Artillery employed there continued to be attached to the
reserve Artillery under Colonel Dickson, and followed the
movements of the army during the campaign. It consisted
of three 18-pounder guns on travelling carriages, and five
24-pounder howitzers, to which were attached Captain
Glubb’s company of the Royal Artillery, commanded by
Captain Power, and a company of Portuguese Artillery,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
commanded by Major Arriaga, with some additional detachments
of the Artillery of both nations. After the battle of
Salamanca, the whole eight pieces were brought forward to
the neighbourhood of Madrid, preparatory to the attack of
Fort la Chine, which was still occupied by the French, but
which ultimately surrendered without a contest. On the
1st September, Lord Wellington quitted Madrid, to proceed
to Arevalo, where the 1st, 5th, 6th, and 7th Divisions were
ordered to assemble preparatory to a movement to the
northward; and Colonel Dickson, with his 18-pounders and
howitzers, was ordered to accompany this corps.</p>

<p>Previous to this movement, measures had been taken to
bring forward from Ciudad Rodrigo the following proportion
of ammunition, viz.<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>On the 9th September, this small siege-train arrived at
Valladolid, and on the following day continued its march
towards Burgos. On the 19th, the Castle of Burgos was
invested, the Artillery park being formed near Villa Toro.</p>

inadequate means has been well known; but how inadequate
these means were will appear from the following statement.

<p>To swell this amount, Colonel Dickson offered a reward
for bringing in any shot fired by the enemy. He found
that the enemy’s 16-pounder shot fitted his own 18-pounder
guns, and that his 8-pounder shot would fit the
9-pounders of the English field brigades. Before the end
of September, about 1400 shot were brought in, in this way.
Colonel Dickson also obtained detachments from the Horse
and Field Brigades occasionally, to give his siege artillerymen
relief; but the duties of the Field Artillery were so
active at this time round Burgos that men could with difficulty
be spared.</p>

<p>Of the Royal Artillery, small in numbers, the casualties
were very great in proportion. Fifteen men were killed, and
forty wounded, during the siege, and in the operations immediately
attending or succeeding it. The officers who were
wounded were Colonel Robe, Captains Dansey and Power,
Lieutenants Elgee and Johnstone.</p>

<p>After severe loss, a hornwork in front of the castle had
been carried by assault on the night of the 19th September,
and on the following night a battery for five guns was commenced.
This battery was armed on the night of the 22nd
with two 18-pounders and three 24-pounder howitzers, in
readiness to open on the inner lines, in the event of an
assault, which had been determined on for that evening on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
the outer line, proving successful. At the same time, a
second battery for six guns was commenced to fire against
the keep of the castle. The assault, which was premature,
failed; and its leader was killed. On the night of the 24th,
the two 18-pounders were taken out of No. 1 Battery, and
drawn along a trench, part of the way towards No. 2, being
replaced in the former by howitzers. On the 25th, the five
howitzers in No. 1 Battery opened a fire to destroy some
palisades, which were used to flank the works of the castle.
The fire was not successful; the howitzers were found to be
very deficient in precision when firing round shot; and the
result was inadequate to the expenditure of ammunition,&mdash;141
rounds,&mdash;a consideration of some importance under the
existing circumstances.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> Lord Wellington, conscious of the
deficiency of his guns, worked now by means of mining; and
on the night of the 29th September, a mine was sprung which
threw down part of the outer wall. An assault was immediately
ordered; but from the darkness of the night the
detachment missed its way, and those who were leading&mdash;having
gained the top of the breach&mdash;were driven down
again for want of support. The whole, therefore, returned
to the trenches.</p>

<p>On the 30th September, the howitzers in No. 1 Battery
were of essential service. About 10 <small>A.M.</small> they opened fire,
with the addition of a French 6-pounder gun, taken in the
hornwork, to demolish a stockade upon the top of a tower
in the outer line a little to the enemy’s right of the breach,
from which the French with musketry annoyed the English
in the sap,&mdash;the fire being so close that every man, who
exposed himself in the slightest degree, was sure to be hit.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
The stockade was strengthened by sand-bags, &amp;c., but, after
three hours’ firing, it was utterly destroyed. The ammunition
expended for this purpose was 136 rounds;&mdash;90 24-pounder
shot, 40 6-pounder French shot, and 6 5½-inch
common shell. It was on this day that Captain Dansey,
who had volunteered for service in the trenches, was
wounded.</p>

<p>The next episode in the Artillery portion of the siege was
the moving the three 18-pounders into a breaching battery
so close to the outer wall, that the guns of the upper work
could not bear on them. The French commander, Dubreton,
lost no time, however, in bringing down a howitzer and a
light gun from the upper work, followed by others as quickly
as he could; and as the breaching battery was very slight,
<span class="sidenote">Napier,
and
‘Memoir of
Sir Hew
Ross.’</span>
the result was serious. “The defences of the battery were
quite demolished, two of the gun-carriages were disabled,
a trunnion was knocked off one of the 18-pounders, and the
muzzle of another was split.” A second, stronger, breaching
battery was then formed, but the plunging fire from the
castle was too severe; the guns which were yet serviceable
were therefore removed back to No. 1 Battery, on the hill of
San Michael. From this position, on the morning of the
4th October, they opened again on the old breach; and a
mine having been exploded with great effect in the same
evening, another assault took place,&mdash;the fourth during the
siege. This was more successful, and a lodgment was effected;
but on the following evening, a large body of the enemy
charged down upon the guards and workmen, and got possession
of the old breach, besides killing and wounding 150
<span class="sidenote">Napier.</span>
men, and destroying their works. On the 7th, the besiegers,
who had continued their advance, and were now close to
the wall, were again charged with fatal effect by the garrison;
and the guns from San Michael, although effecting
a great breach in the second line, suffered severely from
the artillery fire of the enemy,&mdash;another 18-pounder losing
a trunnion. Guns were, however, too few and too valuable to
be considered unserviceable, even after so serious an injury
as this; and the ingenuity of Colonel Dickson produced a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
species of carriage, from which the damaged ordnance could
fire with reduced charges. Between the 7th and the 10th
October, the San Michael guns continued to make breaches
in the works; on the 10th, some ammunition arrived from
Santander; on the 18th, another breach was pronounced
practicable, and Wellington ordered a fifth assault. This
also was unsuccessful; the Allies lost 200 men killed and
wounded; and the siege was at length raised&mdash;on the 20th&mdash;by
Lord Wellington, who had received alarming intelligence
of the approach of a French army to relieve Burgos, and of
the movements of Soult.</p>

<p>The siege of Burgos is a blot on the military reputation of
the Duke of Wellington; and revealed an ignorance of what
artillery could and could not do, which every now and then
<span class="sidenote">Sir Hew
Ross to Sir
Hew Dalrymple,
dated
Madrid,
18 Oct.
1812.</span>
manifested itself in his military operations. If Sir Hew
Ross was correctly informed, the error made by Lord Wellington
was almost criminal, as there was no necessity for
attempting such a siege with so inadequate a siege-train.
“Why he should have undertaken the siege of such a place,”
wrote Major Ross from Madrid, “with means so very inadequate
appears very extraordinary, <i>especially as there was
little or no difficulty in augmenting it to any extent</i>, either
from the guns and ammunition found here, or the ships at
St. Andero.” That Sir Hew wrote with reason seems all
the more probable from the fact that, while the last assault
was actually taking place, two 24-pounders sent from
Santander by Sir Home Popham had passed Reynosa on
<span class="sidenote">Napier.</span>
their way to Burgos. But it may be urged that the responsibility
of undertaking a siege with insufficient Artillery lay
not with the General, but with the Artillery commander.
Those who are familiar with the character of the Duke of
Wellington, as shown in the various narratives of the
Peninsular War, will not make use of this argument. It
was not his wont to allow his plans to be altered by the
representations of his subordinates, nor was he addicted to
the habit of consulting them. Besides, in this particular
instance, he officially relieved the Artillery and Engineer
officers of the responsibility. “The officers,” he wrote, “at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
<span class="sidenote">To Lord
Bathurst
dated
Cabeçon,

1812.</span>
the head of the Artillery and Engineer departments,
Lieut.-Colonel Robe and Lieut.-Colonel Burgoyne, and
Lieut.-Colonel Dickson, who commands the reserve Artillery,
rendered me every assistance; and the failure of
success is not to be attributed to them.” The Duke of
Wellington believed in the bayonet beyond any other
weapon; and if a legitimate belief became occasionally credulity,
it is hardly to be wondered at, when one reflects on
the gallantry of the Infantry which it was the Duke’s good
fortune to command. What seemed to be impossibilities,
when ordered by him, were proved possible in the result;
and the consequently increased belief in the power of the
bayonet seems but natural. But his creed was supported
at a terrible cost. When we find Napier himself,&mdash;Wellington’s
idolater,&mdash;pronouncing his sieges a succession
of butcheries, the criticism of a more temperate student
may be excused. Doubtless, the want of adequate ordnance
was often severely felt by the Duke of Wellington, and
compelled him to an exaggerated use of the other arms;
but this fact was hardly an excuse for neglecting its employment,
when available in sufficient quantities, and obtainable
with moderate exertions.</p>

<p>Nor was the fact that he&mdash;as he justly complained&mdash;<i>never</i>
had a proper amount of Artillery with his armies
any excuse for his making occasionally but an indifferent
use of that which he had. Fortunately, the Duke of Wellington
had merely to encounter Napoleon’s Marshals in
Spain: had he had to meet their master, it is probable that
the creed which he believed and practised might have received
some rude assaults. If one could free oneself of all but purely
professional considerations, one would wish, for the sake of
the student in the art of war, that Napoleon, instead of
Marmont and Clausel, had faced Wellington in the campaign
of 1812. The result would, doubtless, have been the same;
but the ways and means would have been very different.
As it happened, Wellington’s sole encounter with Napoleon
took place on ground chosen by himself, and under circumstances
which yet further assisted his military creed, by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
testing yet again that which he had so often extravagantly
proved, the marvellous endurance, discipline, and courage of
the British Infantry.</p>

<p>The results of the mistaken siege of Burgos are curtly
described by Sir J. T. Jones, in his ‘Journal of the Sieges in
the Peninsula.’ “By its means,” he writes, “a beaten
enemy gained time to recruit his forces, concentrate his
scattered armies, and regain the ascendancy.” The same
author writes, with regard to the service of the Royal
Artillery during the siege: “It is a pleasing act of justice
to the Artillery officers, employed in this attack, to state
that they vied with each other in their exertions and
expedients to meet the hourly difficulties they encountered,
and that no set of men could possibly have drawn
more service than they did from the limited means at
their command.”

Portugal for winter quarters. In leaving Burgos he found
the activity of the commanding officers of Artillery very
beneficial. It enabled him to carry off all his serviceable
guns and stores in a single night; but the absence of cattle
prevented his removing the few French guns which he had
captured in the storming of the hornwork. During the
retreat, the services of the Horse Artillery, under Major
Downman, were of a high order, and called forth the commendation
of Lord Wellington. The troop which most distinguished
itself was Major Bull’s, commanded by Captain
Norman Ramsay, Major Bull having been twice wounded,&mdash;on
one occasion so severely,&mdash;when in advance with the
Cavalry at Torquemada on the night of the 12th September,
1812,&mdash;that he was obliged to be invalided. He does not
reappear in the story of his gallant troop until the battle
of Waterloo.</p>

<p>The retreat terminated on the 24th November, and the
troops went into cantonments, the head-quarters being stationed
at Frenada, and the Artillery at Malhada Sourda,
three miles distant.</p>

<p>An old friend reappears, in the winter of 1812-13, to the
burrower among Artillery records. Captain&mdash;now Brevet-Major&mdash;Frazer,
who last was mentioned in this work in the
account of the operations at Monte Video and Buenos Ayres,
arrived to take command of Major Bull’s troop during that
officer’s absence. His own troop being on home service, he
more easily obtained permission to assume this duty. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
had not been many weeks in the Peninsula before he received
a more important command,&mdash;that which had hitherto
<span class="sidenote">Sir A.
Frazer’s
Letters,
page 89.</span>
been held with such distinction by Major Downman,&mdash;the
command of the Royal Horse Artillery with Lord Wellington’s
armies. Although a reserved man in public, and fond
of solitude, he was almost diffuse in his correspondence.
Happily for those who have succeeded him in the Corps,
his letters from the Peninsula have been collected and published
by one who served in his troop for seven years,&mdash;General
Sir Edward Sabine. These letters, and the unpublished
letters of Sir A. Dickson, give together a most
graphic picture of the operations of 1813, 1814, and 1815,
which cannot but lose by the necessary condensation of the
historian.</p>

<p>In the beginning of 1813, Lord Wellington proceeded to
Lisbon to make the necessary arrangements for the coming
campaign. The intelligence of the French disasters in
Russia had reached him; rumours also came that Soult and
many of the best troops in the French Peninsular armies
had gone to France; and, from his preparations at Lisbon,
it is evident that he had already resolved on offensive
operations, which should, if possible, have the effect of
driving the French out of the Peninsula. That he succeeded
is well known to the reader; it remains to single out, in
this and the following chapter, some of the more salient
points in the campaign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Colonel
Dickson,
to D.-A.-G.

1813.</div>

<p>Colonel Dickson had been ordered to Lisbon, to consult as
to some means of making the Portuguese Artillery more
available for service than it had as yet been; and while
there, he was sent for by Lord Wellington, who had also
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
dated
Lisbon,

1813.</span>
arrived, and was directed to superintend the equipment of a
pontoon train of thirty-four large pontoons, which was to be
sent by river to Abrantes, and there handed over to the
master-pontonier, for use in the coming operations of the
army. This train was destined to be a sore grievance to
the Artillery. It had always to be horsed <i>first</i>, even at the
expense of the Artillery brigades; and its possible wants in
that respect haunted, like a nightmare, the commanding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
officer of the Corps. At this interview Lord Wellington
also expressed considerable anxiety about the brigade of
18-pounder guns, which, he said, he was determined to have
early in the field, as the French were understood to be
<span class="sidenote">Colonel

fortifying positions everywhere. Some new 18-pounders
were expected daily from England; and, on their arrival, he
desired that they should be sent up the Tagus to Abrantes.
This was safely effected; and bullocks were ordered to bring
them thence to head-quarters, at Malhada Sourda.</p>

<p>They were ultimately manned by Captain Morrison’s and
Captain Glubb’s companies of the Royal Artillery; and the
number of carriages in the brigade was no less than
57, viz.<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>About the same time as the 18-pounders arrived from
England, another troop of Horse Artillery, under the command
of Captain Webber Smith, also reached Lisbon. A
change in the armament of the troop, from 6-pounders to
9-pounders, was immediately ordered by Lord Wellington,&mdash;a
change which, on more than one occasion, and in more
than one campaign, has been ordered in the armament of
the Royal Horse Artillery. At this time, also, a recognition
was made by the Portuguese Government of the services
of the Artillery,&mdash;Colonels Robe and Dickson being made
knights of the Tower and Sword.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ibid.
dated
28 March,

<p>The old difficulty as to horses reappeared in the beginning
of 1813. The sickness among these animals during
the winter had been excessive; and the difficulty of purchasing
any in the country seemed daily to increase. This
led to many changes. Among others, Lord Wellington reduced
the whole of the Portuguese Artillery for service
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
in the field to three brigades,&mdash;one 9-pounder and one
6-pounder brigade to be with Sir Rowland Hill’s force, and
one 9-pounder brigade to be attached to the general Artillery
reserve of the army. These three were made very
efficient by this means, and the purchase of a considerable
number of horses avoided.</p>

<p>The campaign of 1813 was distinguished by a feature of
considerable importance. Lord Wellington was now Commander-in-Chief
of all the Spanish armies, and all necessary
correspondence came direct to him, instead of through Cadiz.
The assistance of the <i>Spanish</i> regular troops was never of
much value, even under the new system, except at the
combat of San Marcial and the Bidassoa; but the part taken
by the Partidas, or irregular forces, during the campaign
was not unimportant, and increased the difficulties of the
French troops.</p>

1813.</div>

<p>The French commenced to fall back from Salamanca
towards Burgos, and in the beginning of April had not
above a thousand men in the former place. At the same
time, supplies were arriving from England weekly, and were
disembarked in the northern ports of the Peninsula, with a
view to the advance of the English army. An organization
of the Allied troops was taking place, superior to anything
which had yet been witnessed; and the Corps, whose history
is treated in these pages, improved with the other arms in
this respect. It seems a suitable time to touch on the
improvement in the Field Brigades which had already taken
place; and, at the risk of wearying the reader, to place
before him a specimen of these in the spring of 1813.</p>

<p>The brigade, i.e. battery, which it is proposed to describe
belonged to the 10th Battalion, and was commanded by the
2nd Captain, R. M. Cairnes, a gallant officer, who afterwards
fell at Waterloo. It was pronounced by various
inspecting officers to be the best field brigade with the
army; but Captain Cairnes in his correspondence declined
to accept this honour, as he considered others equally efficient.
It may, therefore, be accepted as a fair type. From a letter
written by Captain Cairnes himself, the following particulars
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
<span class="sidenote">Captain

are obtained; and they exhibit a startling contrast to the
oxen-draught brigades of the commencement of the Peninsular
War. His system was based on that of the Horse
Artillery, now universal in field batteries, in which each
officer was wholly and solely responsible to the captain for
his division, whether in matters of men or <i>matériel</i>.  He
declined to allow the officer of the Driver Corps, who commanded
the drivers attached to the brigade, to have any
control over his men, except as far as their pay and subsistence
were concerned; and by thus giving his own
officers complete responsibility, he received the reward
which such conduct generally ensures, and was able to say,
“My subalterns, Raynes, Bridges, James, and Talbot, are
all most excellent, full of zeal, activity, and intelligence;
they run before me in everything I can desire concerning
their respective charges, and are never more happy than
when in stables.” The chief difficulty in field brigades
had always been in the divided allegiance of the men of the
Driver Corps. The solution of this difficulty, which was
adopted by Captain Cairnes, gradually obtained favour, and
ended in a most natural manner,&mdash;the abolition of the Driver
Corps and the absorption of the drivers into the Regiment.
It took, however, some years to educate the authorities up
to this point; and not until 1822 was the corps actually
<span class="sidenote">Kane’s List.</span>
abolished. Another point in Captain Cairnes’s system to
which he attached great importance, and which he said had
been generally adopted in the other brigades, was that of
having promotion among the non-commissioned officers to
go, not by <i>battalion</i>, but by <i>company</i> seniority; and of
waiving even the question of seniority in the presence of
undoubted superiority. There were faces in Woolwich
which grew very long, and fossil old gentlemen whose
remaining hairs stood on end, at such a perversion of the
old order of things; but Lord Wellington supported the
captains of companies in a measure which on service gave
them a powerful engine for discipline. So, time after time,
does the reader find the real Artillery unit asserting itself.</p>

<p>The artificers with a brigade were 2 wheelers, 2 collar-makers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
1 farrier, 1 jobbing smith, and 4 shoeing smiths.
The non-commissioned officers of the Driver Corps attached
to a 9-pounder brigade were, 1 staff-sergeant, 2 sergeants,
and 6 corporals, one of whom acted as forage sergeant,
under the acting storekeeper of the brigade (a <i>company</i>, not
<i>driver</i> non-commissioned officer), who, again, was under an
assistant commissary-general attached to the brigade (under
the immediate orders of the Captain commanding). This
officer was responsible for the rations and the supply of
corn, for which purpose he had a number of forage mules, at
the rate of one mule to two horses.</p>

<p>Sixteen round tents and two horsemen’s tents were
carried; and, for the convenience of the artificers, two
store waggons accompanied the brigade. The other extra
carriages were the forge waggon, spare wheel carriage, and
the captain’s cart. The brigade itself consisted of 6 guns
and howitzers, 6 ammunition waggons, and 2 reserve ammunition
waggons. The proportion of ammunition carried was
as follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For each 9-pr. gun: 70 round shot, 34 spherical case, and 12 common case.
Total 116 rounds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For each 5½-in. howitzer: 44 spherical case, 8 common case, and 32 common
shell. Total 84 rounds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In each reserve ammunition waggon there were 57 round shot, 21 spherical
case, and 6 common case. Total 84 rounds.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The number of drivers with a brigade was one hundred.
Five of the spare carriages were drawn by mules; those
being selected which were the least likely to go under fire.</p>

<p>This was altogether a most desirable command for a
young 2nd Captain to have on active service; and keenly
did Captain Cairnes enjoy it. His dismay may therefore be
imagined, on receiving, on the 5th May, 1813, a letter from
Colonel Fisher, then commanding the Artillery in the
Peninsula, announcing that Lord Wellington had decided to
take away the horses of his brigade for the service of the
pontoon train, leaving him to the chance of any horses
which might hereafter come from Lisbon. He was not
allowed any time to brood over his troubles, but was ordered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
to meet the pontoons at Sabugal in three days’ time, and
hand over to the Engineer the whole of his stud. Colonel
Fisher’s letter, which was a private communication, sent a
few hours in advance of the official order, held out hopes of
a speedy restoration (which fortunately took place) of the
equipment of his brigade for the field.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> Captain Cairnes’
reply to this letter was so soldierlike, that it is well worthy
<span class="sidenote">Dated
6 May,
1813.</span>
of a place in the records of his Corps. “I return you,” he
wrote, “my dear Colonel, my sincere thanks for your communication
of yesterday’s date, anterior to the arrival of
any <i>order</i>, which would, I think, have set me perfectly
<i>crazy</i>. As it is, I have read your letter over twenty times,
and am yet very unwilling to understand it. Lord
Wellington having fixed on this brigade, I trust we shall
be entitled to every consideration, when it is recollected
that a junior one in all respects is within a league of the
same distance from Sabugal as this place. The pain of
urging anything prejudicial to my valued friend Parker
is superseded by the promise held out to us of a speedy
re-equipment.... I know, my dear Colonel, that you
cannot avert the blow from us, and that the necessity of
the service has forced Lord Wellington to this measure;
therefore, however sorely affected and hurt we may now
feel, you will assure yourself that the whole shall be given
over to the pontoons in as complete and efficient a manner,
as if they were going to be put to our own carriages. I
am full of dread and alarm that our new equipment of
horses and harness will not come up in time to march with
the army; and that (without being so extravagantly
sanguine or conceited as to <i>build on</i> future successes and
good fortune) we shall be too late for the golden opportunity
that a few days will probably offer to other
brigades.”</p>

<p>This allusion of Captain Cairnes to the other Artillery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
brigades with Lord Wellington’s army suggests the propriety
of placing before the reader their distribution at the
opening of the campaign of 1813. This would appear to

to D.-A.-G.
dated
19 May,
1813.</div>

<p>In the middle of May the plan of the campaign was
arranged. The army was ordered to move in two columns,
the head-quarters to leave Frenada on the 22nd May. One
column was to cross the Douro at the mouth of the Coa, and
to advance by Miranda de Douro; the other was to go by
Ciudad Rodrigo. Lord Wellington was to accompany the
latter column, which consisted of Sir Rowland Hill’s corps,
the Light Division, Cavalry, &amp;c. The other column, composed
of the rest of the army, was under Sir T. Graham;
and with it went the pontoon train. It was decided to lay
the pontoon bridge across the Douro, near Miranda, and
thus unite the two columns; this operation to be followed by
the siege of Zamora, which, when concluded, would leave the
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
dated
Matilla,

1813.</span>
Allies masters of the Douro. Following the head-quarters,
the reader finds that they moved to Ciudad Rodrigo on the
22nd May, to Tamames on the 23rd, and to Matilla, about
six leagues from Salamanca, on the 25th. On the way,
Lord Wellington inspected the Portuguese Division, commanded
by General Silveira, and found the men better
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
equipped than they had ever yet been. The brigades of
Artillery with them were commanded by Colonel Tulloh, an
officer of the Royal Artillery, whose zeal and ability were
repaid by the efficiency of the men under his control. The
whole of the reserve Artillery of Lord Wellington’s army,
with the exception of the brigade under Captain Cairnes,
which was now re-equipped, had gone with the main body,
under Sir T. Graham.</p>

<p>Colonel Dickson was now in command of the Artillery,
although junior to many in point of regimental rank; and
as the way in which he obtained the command is not so
generally known in the Regiment as the fact, it seems
desirable to state it. While he was at Corilhaa, preparing
the reserve Artillery for the coming campaign, Colonel
Fisher, who had succeeded to the command of the Artillery
after Colonel Robe was disabled at Burgos, but who had
not held the command as yet in the field, wrote to him,
requesting his attendance at head-quarters without loss of
time. On his arrival, he ascertained that a misunderstanding
had arisen between Lord Wellington and Colonel Fisher,
which had ended in the latter’s requesting permission to
resign, and return to England. Lord Wellington inquired
of Colonel Dickson whether he was senior to Colonel Waller,
who had arrived in Lisbon, and on learning that he was not,
he said, “Colonel Dickson, then, will take the command of
all the Artillery in the field, both British and Portuguese;
and Colonel Waller and General Roza, as commandants of
the Artillery of the two nations, will remain at Lisbon for
the purpose of forwarding supplies.” He then desired
Colonel Fisher to give such explanations of the state of
affairs as would enable Colonel Dickson to enter on his charge.</p>

<p>There would seem to have been considerable hastiness
and injustice on the part of Lord Wellington in this matter.
Colonel Dickson himself, while naturally flattered, could not
<span class="sidenote">To D.-A.-G.
dated
25 May,
1813.</span>
but say, “I am convinced, if Lord Wellington had known
Colonel Fisher’s talents and abilities, he would never have
allowed any such circumstance to take from him such an
officer; and I hope you will forgive my thus presuming to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
discuss in so particular a manner the merits of a superior,
which I am only induced to do in order that you may better
know the merits of an officer I love and esteem; and I am
sure every man of sense or ability in the Corps of Artillery
in the Peninsula will subscribe to what I now state.”</p>

<p>The honour paid to Colonel Dickson was an embarrassing
one. Although his Portuguese rank placed him over all
officers under the rank of Colonel, many such were senior
to him regimentally. This fact demanded great tact from
him in the execution of his duty. Fortunately, he met
with ready, soldierlike co-operation from all; and one,
who had commanded him on service before, in writing to
his friends on the subject, expressed the general feeling
<span class="sidenote">Letters of
Sir A.
Frazer,
page 101.</span>
when he said: “I shall get on very well with Dickson;
he was second to me in the South American Expedition,
and then obeyed my orders with the implicit readiness
which I shall now transfer to his. He is a man of great
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
page 106.</span>
abilities and quickness, and without fear of any one.”
And again: “Colonel Fisher left us the day before yesterday,
sincerely regretted by all. I hope Dickson’s reign may
be long for the sake of the service, but the times are
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
page 110.</span>
slippery.” Yet once more: “Dickson showed me yesterday
a very sensible, plain letter, which he had written to
Colonel Waller, and was just going to send off. Dickson,
too, feels himself awkwardly off, but will bear his honours
well. There is an open, manly simplicity about Dickson
very prepossessing. I hope and trust he will long enjoy
the confidence of the Marquis; and this I should desire
for the sake of the service, independently of any regard
I might have (and I have a very sincere one) for Dickson.”</p>

<p>To return, however, to the movements of the army. On
the 26th May the head-quarters moved forward in the
direction of Salamanca, on approaching which place columns
of the enemy’s infantry were observed, halted at each side
of the town, a part of their cavalry being, however, on the
left bank of the river to watch the movements of the Allies.
As the latter advanced, the cavalry retired across the bridge
into Salamanca, but the infantry for a considerable time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
remained unmoved. In the meantime, Sir Rowland Hill’s
Cavalry and Captain Beane’s troop of Horse Artillery were
ordered to push for the ford of Santa Martha, a little
above the town. As soon as the French saw these troops
approach the river, they moved off with their whole force,
which included about 2500 infantry, two or three squadrons
of cavalry, and three or four guns. General Fane, who was
in command of Sir R. Hill’s Cavalry, passed the river in a
moment, and came up with the French before they had gone
three miles from Salamanca. They were retiring <i>by squares</i>
along the Arivalo road, which leads up the Tormes by Aldea
Langua; and, on overtaking them, the Horse Artillery
opened upon their squares with considerable execution. The
pursuit was thus continued for five or six miles, the Horse
Artillery cannonading them from every available point. The
Artillery fire was interfered with by the repeated interposition
of the Cavalry between the guns and the enemy;
but was nevertheless very efficient. According to Colonel
Dickson,&mdash;of 400 killed, wounded, and prisoners, lost by
the enemy,&mdash;100 were victims to the Artillery fire alone;
and the squares were so shaken by it, that, if the regiments
moving on the flank had pushed on, the whole force might
have been captured. Lord Wellington, however, seeing that
the pursuing Cavalry were somewhat exhausted, desisted
from further pursuit. The head-quarters halted at Salamanca
on the 27th May, and orders were issued for their
transfer to the other army, north of the Douro. On the
28th, therefore, the head-quarter staff proceeded to Almeida,
and on the 29th to Miranda, crossing the Douro at a ferry
near the latter place. Lord Wellington, himself, remained
one day later at Salamanca; and on the 29th proceeded the
whole distance to Miranda. On the 30th the head-quarters
were moved to Carvajales, and on the same evening the Esla
was reconnoitred, and preparations made to cross it on the
following morning. Small parties of the enemy were seen
on the opposite bank with two guns. Early on the morning
of the 31st, the Hussar Brigade, Gardiner’s and Webber
Smith’s troops of Horse Artillery, and two regiments of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
Infantry crossed,&mdash;upon which the French parties immediately
retired. The Infantry found the greatest difficulty
in crossing,&mdash;the river being both deep and rapid,&mdash;and
several men were drowned. A pontoon bridge was therefore
made in a couple of hours, over which the rest of the
army passed, with the exception of the Cavalry, Artillery,
and waggons, which forded the river. A special pontoon
bridge was made for the 18-pounder brigade, over which it
passed with safety. On the 1st June head-quarters proceeded
to Zamora, and the army completed the passage of the Esla,&mdash;the
French evacuating Zamora as the Allies approached.</p>

<p>“Thus,” wrote Colonel Dickson, “we succeeded in our
manœuvre of turning the Douro, and getting possession
of that river without sustaining the smallest loss. It has
been a bold one; but, by his Lordship’s rapidity in moving
the army, and transferring himself from one point to the
other, I think the French did not succeed in discovering
our real intention until it was too late for them to hinder
it. Otherwise, we found the Esla such an obstacle, that
if they only had had ten or twelve thousand men on that
river, the passage of it would have been a serious operation
to us, and could not have been effected without either
great loss of time or of men, and probably both.”</p>

<p>On the 2nd June, the French abandoned Toro, and Wellington’s
head-quarters proceeded there,&mdash;remaining over
the 3rd, on which day, and on the 4th, the force which had
advanced by Salamanca, under Sir R. Hill, crossed the
Douro. On the 4th, the army moved forward in three
columns,&mdash;the right, under Sir R. Hill, in the direction of
Valladolid; the centre upon La Mota, and the left under
Sir Thomas Graham towards Rio Seco. The head-quarters
proceeded to La Mota on the 4th, to Castro Monte on the
5th, and to Ampudia on the 6th; the French abandoning
Valladolid, as the Allies advanced, and retiring upon Palencia
and Duenas. The armies continued to keep within a
day’s march of one another: indeed, when the Allies reached
Palencia, on the 7th June, the rear-guard of the enemy was
clearly visible from the high ground. On the 12th (the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
pursuit still going on steadily, and Wellington continuing
this, his greatest, march in the most persevering, relentless
manner) the French army had reached Monasterio and the
neighbourhood of Burgos,&mdash;but indicated no sign of discontinuing
its retreat. Warned by past experience, Wellington
had decided to take no active measures against Burgos, but
merely to blockade it with part of the Spanish army, leaving
the English troops undiminished. In the meantime, Sir
Thomas Graham, with the left column of the army, inclined
to his left in the direction of the upper part of the Ebro;
with the view, it was believed, of turning or crossing that
river. The events of the next few days, however, modified
matters very much. On reaching Villa Diego, Lord Wellington
ascertained that the Castle of Burgos had been
blown up by the French, and was in utter ruins. Sir
Richard Fletcher, of the Engineers, accompanied by Colonels
Dickson and May, and Major Frazer of the Artillery, penetrated
into the place, although the French rear-guard was
still close at hand, and brought back the report. Joseph
Buonaparte had meditated taking up a position at Burgos,
but it having been pronounced unwise, he continued to
retire on Vittoria. His army&mdash;which was known to be
<i>en route</i> for France&mdash;was embarrassed with huge convoys of
spoils,&mdash;and crowds of followers, male and female, who were
unwilling to be left in Spain, unprotected by the French
troops. Lord Wellington now executed a very brilliant
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Dickson
to D.-A.-G.
dated
19 June,
1813.</span>
strategical manœuvre,&mdash;the crossing of the Ebro. The route
by which he abruptly moved his army was unfrequented and
considered impracticable. The descent to the river by the
Puente de Arenas was by a very narrow and steep pass,
opening into a small but fertile valley, entirely surrounded
by high mountains, with the river running through it.
The <i>sortie</i> from the valley of Puente de Arenas was by
a road running for a considerable distance close to the
river, with stupendous rocks overhanging on either side.
Had this movement been foreseen, a very small body of
the enemy could have impeded the passage of the army.
The advantages of this manœuvre were many. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
<span class="sidenote">Cust’s
‘Annals of
the Wars.’</span>
French communications with the coast were cut off, and
a new base was opened for the operations of the Allies.
The English fleet entered Santander, and commissariat communication
was opened with the coast. Wellington was
also in a position to threaten the communications between
Vittoria and the Pyrenees, and the French found the English
already in rear of their right. An engagement took place
between Sir Thomas Graham and the French General, Reille,
who had been detached to protect the communications between
the French army and their own country; and the
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Dickson
to D.-A.-G.
19 June,
1813.</span>
Light Division&mdash;with which Lord Wellington himself was&mdash;succeeded
in surprising General Mancune’s division on the
march,&mdash;killing a good many, dispersing one brigade, and
capturing an immense quantity of baggage, and 300
prisoners. But these were merely the preliminaries to a
battle, which, in its results, was unsurpassed in the whole
narrative of the Peninsular War. Writing on the evening
of the 19th June, from Subijana de Morillas, three leagues
south-west of Vittoria, Colonel Dickson said: “We can see
the whole French army on their march to Vittoria;&mdash;the
column is not more than six or seven miles off. To-morrow
we expect to move forward upon Vittoria, which,
I think, must lead to something.”</p>

<p>In proceeding to discuss the share of the Royal Artillery
at the battle of Vittoria, it has unfortunately to be premised
that the most valuable letter on the subject has been
mislaid, or lost. In writing to General Macleod after the
<span class="sidenote">Dated
23 June,
1813.</span>
battle, Colonel Dickson said: “I know Frazer has given you
some account of it, so I will not enter into further details
at present, except on our own matters.” And in two subsequent
letters, he said: “Frazer’s letter will have explained
everything.” Now, in the published letters of Sir Augustus
Frazer, this letter is not to be found; nor is there
much in his allusions to the battle in his other letters to
assist the Artilleryman in tracing the services of his Corps.
The loss of the letter is, to a certain extent, compensated
by details given in subsequent letters from Colonel Dickson,
but still remains irreparable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span></p>

<p>It would be beyond the province of this work to describe
the battle of Vittoria, as a whole. In the pages of the <i>general</i>
military historian such a description can be found. In these,
the regimental statistics alone need be reproduced. The
general plan of the battle is, doubtless, familiar to all:&mdash;the
plain in front of Vittoria, into which&mdash;as into a trap&mdash;Joseph
Buonaparte poured all his troops and convoys;&mdash;the one road
available for the retreat of his forces to France, which was
menaced&mdash;but not with sufficient decision&mdash;by Wellington’s
left;&mdash;the confusion in the space between the French army
and the town of Vittoria, where mobs of terrified fugitives
were mingled with heaps of vehicles and stores;&mdash;the three-handed
assault of the Allies, advancing with steadfast purpose
from three quarters at once;&mdash;the frequent Artillery duels, in
which the Artillery on both sides so greatly distinguished
themselves;&mdash;the grand final effort of the French artillery,
<span class="sidenote">Napier.</span>
when “more than eighty guns, massed together, pealed with
such a horrid uproar, that the hills laboured and shook,
and streamed with fire and smoke, amidst which the dark
figures of the French gunners were seen, bounding with a
frantic energy;” and then the wild rout, the headlong
flight of an army leaving its guns and everything behind
it;&mdash;the shrieks of women, the terror of men, rising so
vividly before his mind as he wrote, that Napier exclaimed,
“It was the wreck of a nation!” But no such ambitious
description is required in detail from the mere regimental
historian. What is demanded from him is the narrative,
from old records that have never seen the light, of the
share taken by his corps on this eventful day.</p>

<p>The number of guns, exclusive of the Spanish, which
were brought into action by the Allies at Vittoria was ninety;
but the French had considerably more. There happened in
this battle, on the 21st June, 1813, what rarely happens;&mdash;<i>every</i>
brigade of Artillery was brought into action. In his
official report, Colonel Dickson said that he had reason to be
satisfied with the conduct of the officers and men of the
Royal Artillery on this occasion; that their skill and bravery
were highly conspicuous, as were their exertions in bringing
forward the Artillery through a difficult and intersected
<span class="sidenote">Dated
23 June,

country, both during the attack and the pursuit. “In short,”
he added, “I can safely assert that artillery could not be
better served; and, to the credit of the officers, I have to
add that from the beginning of the day to the last moment
of the pursuit, it was always to be found where it
was wanted.” In his private letter to General Macleod,
Colonel Dickson particularised some of the officers who had
especially distinguished themselves; and the following extract
deserves publication: “I cannot close this letter without
mentioning the valuable assistance my friend Frazer
afforded during the whole business. I may truly say he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
flew from one troop to another,&mdash;accompanying them into
action and attending to their supply, or looking out for
roads for them to move. You, who know Frazer so well,
can easily anticipate what he would be on such an
occasion.”</p>

<p>The massing of the English Artillery was effected at
Vittoria to an unprecedented extent, and with most happy
results. It might at first be assumed that the admirable
use made of this arm on that occasion is a sufficient reply
to any insinuations against Lord Wellington’s knowledge of
Artillery tactics. Unfortunately for him, a letter has survived
which proves, on the best authority, that to accident
alone was this artillery display due. “The nature of the
country,” wrote Colonel Dickson, “and want of roads, was
the means of throwing a large proportion of our Artillery
together, away from their divisions, which I availed myself
of, and by employing them in masses it had a famous
effect. This was adjoining to the great road to Vittoria;
and the French brought all the artillery they could to
oppose our advance, so that the cannonade on one spot was
very vigorous. In none of our Peninsular battles have we
ever brought so much cannon into play; and it was so
well directed that the French were generally obliged to
retire ere the Infantry could get at them. There were
few or no instances of the bayonet being used during the
day.”</p>

<p>The number of guns captured from the enemy was no less
than 151, besides 415 caissons. Of gun ammunition 14,249
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>

1,973,400 musket ball-cartridges. The other spoils were

short, but satisfactory, allusion to the services of the

dated

1813.</span>
Artillery:&mdash;“The Artillery was most judiciously placed by
Lieut.-Colonel Dickson, and was well served; and the army
is particularly indebted to that Corps.” During the pursuit
of the enemy after the battle, Colonel Dickson kept the
Artillery well up,&mdash;and was rewarded, as will be seen from

the following anecdote:&mdash;“In the pursuit after Vittoria,
in the bad roads, Lord Wellington saw a French column
making a stand, as if to halt for the night. ‘Now Dickson,’
said he, ‘if we had but some Artillery up!’  ‘They
are close by, my Lord.’ And in ten minutes, from a hill
on the right, Lieut.-Colonel Ross’s Light Division guns
began; and away went the French two leagues farther
off.” The same author from whom this quotation is made
says: “Dickson, though only a Captain in the Royal Regiment
of Artillery, now conducts the whole department
here, <i>because he makes no difficulties</i>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Wellington’s
Despatch,
dated

<p>During the pursuit, the only remaining guns&mdash;two in
number&mdash;taken away by the French from the field, were
captured,&mdash;one being disabled by the fire of the Chestnut
Troop, and the other being taken within a league of Pampeluna,
<span class="sidenote">‘Memoirs of
Sir Hew

page 41.</span>
in which direction the French had retreated.</p>

<p>The results which followed the battle of Vittoria are summarised
by Napier in his description of the campaign, in
which that battle was the chief incident. “In this campaign
of six weeks,” he wrote, “Wellington, with 100,000
men, marched 600 miles, passed six great rivers, gained
one decisive battle, invested two fortresses, and drove
120,000 veteran troops from Spain.” The fortresses referred
to were Pampeluna and San Sebastian; and it is now
proposed to treat of the double siege of the latter, as an
episode of essential importance in the history of the Regiment,
and one concerning which Sir Alexander Dickson left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
much valuable information, yet unpublished. Before doing
so, however, there are two incidents which deserve to be
mentioned.</p>

<p>In the <i>brevet</i> which followed Vittoria, Majors Frazer and
Ross were made Lieut.-Colonels, and 2nd Captain Jenkinson
(of the Chestnut Troop) was made Major. Captain Jenkinson’s
brevet promotion was the first which had been received
by a 2nd Captain of Artillery. In the beginning of
the year 1813, the 2nd Captains serving in the Peninsula
had memorialised Lord Wellington on the subject. The
<span class="sidenote">Sir Henry
Torrens to
Lord Wellington,
3 March,
1813.</span>
memorial having been referred to England, a favourable
reply was given, and Captain Jenkinson’s promotion was the
first fruits. In addition to the somewhat scanty recognition
of the Artillery in this <i>brevet</i>, a boon was granted, which is
described in the following extract from a letter written by
the Master-General of the Ordnance, Lord Mulgrave, to
<span class="sidenote">Dated
16 July,
1813.</span>
Colonel Dickson:&mdash;“On receipt of your letter, addressed to
Major-General Macleod, I did not fail to bring under the
consideration of the Prince Regent the very striking and
unexampled circumstance of the whole of the British
Artillery having been brought into action at the battle of
Vittoria, and the whole of the enemy’s Artillery having
been captured in the glorious victory which crowned the
exertions of the Allies on that ever-memorable occasion.
His Royal Highness has been graciously pleased&mdash;in consideration
of the peculiar circumstances above stated&mdash;to
mark His Royal Highness’s approbation of the particular
and successful activity of the Corps of Royal Artillery
under your orders, by granting severally to the officers
entrusted with the command of divisions or brigades an
allowance for good service in the following proportions:&mdash;To
the officers commanding divisions, each 10<i>s.</i> per diem;
to the officers commanding brigades, each 5<i>s.</i> per diem;
and to yourself a similar allowance for good service of 20<i>s.</i>
per diem.”</p>

<p>Better, far better, that these words had never been
penned, and that the generous thought had died in its conception!
For the day was to come when a reference to this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
precedent after Vittoria should call forth from him under
whom the representatives of the Corps had so often and so
<span class="sidenote">Vide
Appendix
A.</span>
bravely fought, a letter as cruel and unjust to those of whom
it treated, as it was unworthy of him who penned it.</p>

<p>The other incident is one which has become a household
word in the Regiment. If there is one name more familiar
than another to the Artilleryman, it is that of Norman
Ramsay. From public orders and the pages of history his
gallantry and professional skill may be learnt; but it is
from the pages of private correspondence that one ascertains
how lovable he was. He joined the Regiment in 1798, and
he fell at Waterloo; and yet in that short space of seventeen
years he had gained the love of his brother officers without
exception, the devotion of his men, and the admiration of
all. A man <i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>, he reminds one of the
knights of Arthur, whose pleasure was to

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Live pure, speak true, right wrong, follow the king.”<br /></span>
</span></span>

A thorough master of his profession, he earned the respect
as well as the love of those whom he commanded:
and let all remember that the love of men for their commander
must have that element in it to make the gift worth
having. The personal qualities of an officer may attract the
affection of his men; but if he is deficient in knowledge of
his profession, there will be in their love an element approaching
pity, which will be fatal to their confidence in the
hour of trial. It will be like the love for a child,&mdash;pure,
warm, and sincere,&mdash;but not such as will demand from the
soldier, in the day of battle, blind confidence and unhesitating
obedience. In Norman Ramsay were combined all the
virtues which compel affection, and all the skill which demands
respect. But there was more: he possessed that
professional enthusiasm, which hallows the dullest tasks, and
gilds the severest hardship. His pride in his troop made
its men strive to be worthy of his good opinion; and it is
in this way that a commander can with certainty generate
<i>esprit de corps</i> among his men. Let him but place before
them a standard of perfection, even although unattainable,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
and, in their voluntary efforts to reach it, they will rise
far higher, than if driven by order, or goaded by fear of
punishment.</p>

<p>Successful in all his aims, Norman Ramsay was yet so fortunate
as to escape jealousy. The letters of his brother-officers,&mdash;written
for private eye alone, but subsequently
published,&mdash;show this to a singular extent. Sir Alexander
Dickson, Sir Augustus Frazer, Sir Hew Ross, Major Cairnes,
and others,&mdash;all men of different characters and disposition,&mdash;rarely
wrote without a loving word or kind inquiry
about Ramsay. If his troop distinguished itself, they all
rejoiced as if it had been their own; if he met with any
grief, they longed to share it; and if sorrow came upon
themselves, their first instinct was to confide it to him.
In October, 1813, a distinguished Artilleryman, Sir Howard
Douglas, lost in action a brother whom he deeply loved.
Older than Ramsay, one yet finds without surprise that it
<span class="sidenote">Sir A.
Frazer’s
Letters,
page 314.</span>
was to him he went, “bitterly lamenting his loss.” So
also when any of them came within his reach at any time,
the letters always speak alike,&mdash;as if every one would readily
understand the writers’ longings&mdash;“I <i>must</i> go and see
Ramsay.”</p>

<p>In these pages, later on, the story will have to be told
how, in the midst of the din of battle, there seemed to fall
a silence like a pall, as he, the brave and much-loved, met
with a soldier’s death; but the grief was then that of his
friends. The incident now to be told tells of a grief which
was his own,&mdash;which never quitted him while he lived, and
which was said by many who knew him to have led him to
court unnecessary exposure on the day in which he died.
At Vittoria, Bull’s troop, commanded by Ramsay, had done
special service. On the following day, during the pursuit,
<span class="sidenote">Published
Letters of
Sir A.
Frazer,
page 183.</span>
“Lord Wellington spoke to Ramsay as he passed; desired
him to take his troop for the night to a village near, adding
that if there were orders for the troop in the course of
the night, <i>he would send them</i>.” No orders came; but
at 6 <small>A.M.</small> an Assistant Quartermaster-General arrived, and
ordered him to join the brigade to which he belonged. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
troop at once marched, but was shortly afterwards overtaken
by a written order from General Murray, the Quartermaster-General
<span class="sidenote">Published
Letters of
Sir A.
Frazer,
page 186.</span>
of the army, directing “Captain Ramsay’s troop to
rejoin General Anson’s brigade.” The troop halted, while
Ramsay rode on to discover the road; and at this moment
Lord Wellington rode up, and called repeatedly for him.
“His Lordship,” wrote Sir Augustus Frazer, “then called for
Dickson, whose horse being unable at the instant to clear
a wide ditch over which we had just passed, I rode up to
mention the circumstance to Lord Wellington, who ordered
me to put Captain Ramsay in arrest, and to give the command
of the troop to Captain Cator. This I accordingly
did.... It appears that Lord Wellington had intended
that Ramsay’s troop should not have moved that morning
till he himself sent orders, and his Lordship declared that
he had told Ramsay so. This Ramsay affirms he never
heard or understood; and his Lordship’s words, repeated
by Ramsay, young Macleod, and a sergeant and corporal,
all at hand when his Lordship spoke to Ramsay, are precisely
the same, and do not convey such a meaning. I
spoke instantly to Lord Fitzroy Somerset on the subject,
who, together with every other individual about head-quarters,
was, and is, much concerned at the circumstance.
Nay, two days afterwards, when the despatches were
making out, every friendly suggestion was used by several
that Ramsay might be mentioned as he deserved; but I
have reason to believe that he is not. There is not, among
the many good and gallant officers who are here, one of
superior zeal or devotion to the service to Ramsay, who
has given repeated proofs of spirit and good conduct.
Admitting, contrary to all evidence, that he had mistaken
the verbal orders he received, this surely is a venial
offence, and one for which long-tried and faithful services
should not be forgotten.... Few circumstances have
engaged more general attention, or occasioned more regret.
It has naturally been expected that after the first moment
was over, a deserving officer would, at least, have been
released from a situation most galling to a gallant spirit.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
... I trust this will soon be the case; but ... I am
at a loss to account for the delay in a point so easily
settled. In the meanwhile, Ramsay bears up with great
fortitude, although he deeply feels.” Writing on the same
<span class="sidenote">‘Memoir of
Sir Hew
Ross,’
page 46.</span>
subject, some weeks later, Sir Hew Ross said: “Norman
Ramsay is at present with his troop in this neighbourhood,
and we are much together. He is quite well, and bears
his unjust treatment, and consequent disappointment, in
the manly and proper way that might be expected of him.”
For a considerable time he was kept under arrest; and the
numerous applications on his behalf, including a very urgent
one from Sir Thomas Graham, seemed to have the effect of
irritating Lord Wellington. The consciousness of having
done an unjust act is rendered more difficult to bear, when
the victim has been one for whom affection has been entertained;
and it was believed in the army that, as far as his
undemonstrative nature would allow, Lord Wellington had a
strong liking for Norman Ramsay. There was no doubt of
the devotion of the latter for his great chief; and the keen
suffering caused by injustice from a person whom one loves
must be realised to be fully understood. He was happily
released from arrest in time to carry his brave troop through
the many actions, with which the war concluded; and he
received a <i>brevet</i> promotion for these services; but he was
never the same man. At Waterloo, on the morning of the
battle, as the Duke rode along the line, he saw Ramsay at
the head of his troop for the first time since his arrival in
<span class="sidenote">Communicated
by Sir J.
Bloomfield,
R.H.A.</span>
Flanders. He accosted him cheerfully as he passed. Ramsay
merely bowed his head sadly, until it nearly touched his
horse’s mane, but could not speak. In a few hours he was
where sorrow and injustice are unknown.</p>

<p>It is necessary now to turn to the siege of San Sebastian.
Pampeluna was blockaded and ultimately starved into submission;
but stronger measures were adopted with San
Sebastian, into which place Marshal Jourdan had thrown a
<span class="sidenote">Jones’s
‘Sieges of
the Peninsula,’
vol.
ii. chap. ii.</span>
garrison of between 3000 and 4000 men. On the land side,
it was invested by the left wing of the Allied army, under
Sir Thomas Graham; and on the sea side it was blockaded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
by a squadron under Sir George Collyer. On the 4th July,
1813, Lord Wellington wrote as follows to Colonel Dickson:
<span class="sidenote">Dated
Lanz,
4 July,
1813.</span>
“From what I have heard of San Sebastian, I am inclined
to form the siege of that place, and I shall be very much
obliged to you if you will send an officer to Bilbao to order
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Dickson
to D.-A.-G.
dated
10 July,
1813.</span>
the train from thence to Passages.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> The order was immediately
obeyed, and Captain Morrison’s 18-pounder brigade
was also directed to proceed to Passages for the same purpose.
On the 12th, Lord Wellington reconnoitred San
Sebastian, and on the 14th, he departed to join the army on
the field, leaving Colonel Dickson to conduct the Artillery
part of the siege. Lord Wellington’s operations in the
field were at this time of a very delicate nature. The Allied
army in the east of Spain had failed, and had raised the
siege of Tarragona; while, in his front and on his right,
there were menacing French armies. French garrisons in
Pampeluna and San Sebastian also weakened his available
force, by demanding troops to watch them.</p>

<p>Extract from a letter dated Passages de la Calçada, 12 Sept. 1813:</p>

<p>“These officers vied with each other in their endeavours to forward the
object in view in the most indefatigable manner.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Colonel Dickson</span> to
<span class="smcap">General Macleod</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The story of San Sebastian divides itself into three parts,&mdash;viz.:
the first siege, terminating in an unsuccessful assault;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
the blockade; and the second and successful siege. The
<i>matériel</i> at the disposal of the Artillery at the first siege
was inadequate, even when supplemented by field guns, and
guns borrowed from the navy; but during the second siege
the supply was ample, and the fire most efficient. In sieges,
the association of the Artillery with the breach made by
them ceases when the assault commences; but this was not
so in the second siege of San Sebastian, when the assault
would certainly have failed but for the powerful fire maintained
by the Artillery over the heads of the assailants. Of
this, however, more hereafter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Colonel
Dickson
to D. A. G.</div>

<p>San Sebastian is built on a neck of land jutting out into
the sea; and the first point which it was necessary to secure
on the land side was a place which had been fortified,&mdash;the
convent of St. Bartholomew. This was taken, after four
days’ vigorous cannonade, by assault, on the 17th July, 1813.
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Dickson’s
Diary; and
Jones’s
‘Peninsular
Sieges.’</span>
The guns employed against the convent and the adjoining
redoubt were placed in the batteries of the left attack,
numbered 1 and 2, and were four 18-pounders and two
8-inch howitzers. Before the assault, however, Sir Thomas
Graham, who had been left by Lord Wellington in command,
<span class="sidenote">Sir Thomas
Graham to
Colonel
Dickson,

1813.</span>
directed as many field guns as possible to be brought
into play in support. This was done; and they were
found to be of material assistance, and were served with
great effect during the assault. The number of rounds
expended against the convent and redoubt was 3000: a large
<span class="sidenote">Jones’s
‘Sieges.’</span>
quantity of hot shot was employed; and in his despatch
announcing the success of the assault, Sir Thomas Graham
<span class="sidenote">To Lord
Wellington,
dated
18 July,
1813.</span>
said: “I cannot conclude this report without expressing
my perfect satisfaction with all the officers and men of
the Royal Artillery, both in the four-gun battery employed
for three days against the convent, and on the opposite
bank of the river, whence several field-pieces were served
with great effect.”</p>

<p>The batteries against the town had been in course of preparation
during the bombardment of the convent; and the
following tables extracted from Sir A. Dickson’s letters and
returns will show at a glance much that would otherwise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
occupy much space in description. The numbering of the
batteries differs from that of the Engineers; but where
possible, <i>both</i> have been shown.</p>

<p>The batteries were divided into those of the right and left
attacks. Lieut.-Colonel May assisted, during the first siege,
under Colonel Dickson; the left or detached attack was
under Colonel Hartmann, K.G.A., and the batteries were

<p>The ammunition expended during the first siege amounted
to 27,719 rounds, and, as the batteries did not open until
the 20th July, and the assault took place on the morning of
the 25th, the rapidity of fire must have been excessive. In
alluding to this, General Jones says: “The expenditure
from the breaching battery alone, on the 22nd July,
amounted to 350 rounds a gun, expended in about 15
hours of daylight. Such a rate of firing was probably
never equalled at any siege, great accuracy of range being
at the same time observed.” Captain Dubourdieu of the
Royal Artillery was mortally wounded in the batteries on
the first day; and the total loss of the Corps and the Portuguese
Artillery during the first operation was 12 <i>killed</i>,
and 44 <i>wounded</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span></p>

<p>On the morning of the 24th July, two breaches were
deemed quite practicable, but the assault which was first
intended to take place on that day was postponed until the
25th at 5 <small>A.M.</small> It completely failed: a certain amount of
gallantry was shown by the attacking troops, but there was
a feeling of depression among them, which seemed to have
arisen from exaggerated ideas of the difficulty of the task.
Sir Thomas Graham, while giving due credit for the courage
which was shown, and which was proved by the list of
casualties, felt that his troops were not in the same mood as
those who stormed Badajoz. In a letter to Colonel Dickson
<span class="sidenote">To Colonel
Dickson,
dated
8 p.m.
25 July,
1813.</span>
on the night of the assault, he said: “It is evident to me
that <i>the troops here</i> never will carry this breach, unless
every annoyance but the castle fire (which is not come-at-able
at present) be removed.... The approach to the
breach is certainly very unfavourable, and does not admit
of attempting to feed or renew the attack, as all must go in
one narrow column over rough, slippery stones,&mdash;and <i>that</i>,
with an enfilading and flanking fire, occasioned the complete
failure; nor would it have been possible at last to
get any other fresh men from the trenches to have advanced.”
Further than keeping up a fire which would not
interfere with the attacking party, the Artillery had nothing
to do with the assault; but Sir Thomas Graham in reporting
the failure took the opportunity of referring to their services
on the preceding days, in the following gratifying terms:&mdash;“The
<span class="sidenote">To Lord
Wellington,
dated
27 July,
1813.</span>
conduct, throughout the whole of the operations of
the siege hitherto, of the officers and men of the Royal
Artillery and Engineers, never was exceeded in indefatigable
zeal, activity, and gallantry; and I beg to
mention particularly to your Lordship Lieut.-Colonels
Dickson, Frazer, and May, and Major Webber Smith, of the
Royal Artillery”....</p>

<div class="sidenote">Colonel
Dickson to
D.-A.-Gen.
dated
12 Aug.
1813.</div>

<p>Lord Wellington came in person to look at the state of
affairs, and as it was not deemed prudent to repeat the
assault, and the ammunition of the Artillery was nearly
expended, the operations against the place were brought to
a close;&mdash;greatly to the disappointment of many. After the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
failure of the assault, Lord Wellington ordered, for security,
that all the guns, with the exception of a few pieces, should
be removed from the batteries, and a blockade substituted
for a siege. The forward movement of Soult’s army, which
will be discussed hereafter, produced a further order to
embark the guns and stores. On the French being driven
back, Colonel Dickson received orders to land them again;
the batteries also were repaired, new ones constructed, and
everything put in readiness for a second siege as soon as
ammunition should arrive from England. The arrival of
this was, however, delayed beyond the endurance of Sir
Thomas Graham, who was not so familiar with the dilatory
habits of the Civil branch of the Ordnance, as Colonel
Dickson was. In one of his numerous letters to the latter
<span class="sidenote">Dated
7 Aug.
1813.</span>
during this period, he wrote: “It is too provoking to think
of such mistakes and delays at home, where they have
nothing else to do or think of, but the execution of demands
made at an early enough period to give full time
for preparation.” Sir Thomas Graham’s correspondence
shows at this time a feverish, almost fretful, anxiety about
the preparations for the second siege, which was not unnatural
in a General anxious to wipe out the recollection of
failure. The reader of his letters cannot resist a wish to
have seen his face when the incident occurred, described by
Napier: “With characteristic negligence, this enormous
armament (i.e. two new battering trains) had been sent out
from England with no more shot and shells than would
suffice for one day’s consumption.” At length, everything
was in readiness, and the batteries opened on the 26th
August, 1813. Before entering on the narrative of the
siege, a list of the batteries with their respective armaments
will be given, extracted not merely from Sir A. Dickson’s
official returns, but also from private letters written at
the time,&mdash;with all the necessary information at his hand.</p>

<p>To commence with the <i>Left Attack</i>. The only batteries
used before the storming of the city on the 31st August
were those numbered 5 and 6,&mdash;containing 7 24-pounders,
2 8-inch howitzers, and Captain Morrison’s brigade of six
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
18-pounders. Others will be given, hereafter, which were
used at the bombardment of the castle. The object of the
fire of the left attack was to breach the right face of the
left demi-bastion, and the curtain over it; also, the face of
the left demi-bastion of the hornwork, and generally to
annoy the defences. Lieut.-Colonel Hartmann, K.G.A., again
commanded the left attack.</p>

<p>The <i>Right Attack</i> was under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Frazer, and consisted of the following batteries, according

<p>The breaching batteries were Nos. 4 and 5, but more
especially the latter. Field officers were detailed for duty
alternately in these two batteries, while the firing was going
on: Majors Dyer and Webber Smith being in No. 4, and
Majors Buckner and Sympher, K.G.A., in No. 5.</p>

<p>According to Sir J. Jones, the batteries opened with a
general salvo from 57 guns;&mdash;according, however, to Colonel
Dickson, only 48 were in action. The whole commenced by
signal, and as Sir Thomas Graham wrote to Colonel Dickson,
<span class="sidenote">Dated
26 Aug.
1813.</span>
“Nothing could be more imposing than the opening of your
fire this morning.” The guns in the left attack were
found to be too distant for the effect required; but the fire
from the batteries of the right attack was so destructive,
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Dickson
to D.-A.-G.
1 Sept.
1813.</span>
that in the course of five days, from the 26th to the 30th,
the demi-bastion was demolished, a breach made in the curtain
behind it, the towers on each side of the former breach
laid down, and the wall laid open which connected the curtain
with the left of the first breach. The batteries of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
left attack laid open a hornwork; and four guns having been
brought forward into a battery (No. 7) which was much
nearer the works, they breached the right face of the demi-bastion,
and greatly assisted in bringing down the end of
the curtain.</p>

<p>About 11 o’clock <small>A.M.</small> on the 31st August, the column for
the assault, which had now been ordered, moved forward,
and arrived at the breach with comparatively little loss.
The defence of the French was such, however, that no
lodgment could be effected,&mdash;more than one attempt having
been repulsed; and as the enemy occupied a higher position
than his assailants, he was able to fire down upon them and
inflict great loss. It was at this time that Sir Thomas
Graham ordered the Artillery to commence a fire, which has
received the greatest praise at the hands of historians, and
of which the following graphic description, from Colonel
Dickson’s pen, cannot fail to interest the reader:&mdash;“The
great body of our cannon, howitzers, and carronades fired
upon the great curtain and behind it&mdash;over the heads of
our own men (<i>only a few feet perpendicular lower down</i>),
with a vigour and accuracy probably unprecedented in the
annals of artillery. It was the admiration and surprise of
Sir Thomas Graham, and Marshal Beresford, and all who
beheld it. No one could say there was a single error to
the disadvantage of our own people; and the force of the
fire entirely prevented the enemy making any effort along
the rampart to drive us from the breach. I must say
the enemy stood with great firmness, firing over the
parapet as well as they could, notwithstanding numbers
had their heads taken off by our round shot. In short, on
this occasion, our artillery was served in such a manner
that I would not have believed it, had I not seen it.”</p>

<p>Sir J. Jones says of the Artillery fire at this time, that it
was admirable, and occasioned no casualties among the
assailants; and Napier describes the stream of missiles, like
a horrid tempest, in its fearful course strewing the rampart
with the mangled limbs of the defenders. It was a critical
time; and a want of precision on the part of the Artillery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
<span class="sidenote">Dated
Oyarzun,
1 Sept.
1813.</span>
would have produced a fatal panic among the assailants. In
his despatch to Lord Wellington, announcing the success of
the assault, Sir Thomas Graham admitted that, prior to the
Artillery coming into action on this occasion, the state of the
attack was desperate; and he described the fire (which after
consultation with Colonel Dickson he ventured to order) as
having been “kept up with a precision of practice beyond
all example.” The ultimate success was almost accidental.
A large number of shells and combustible materials had
been accumulated above the breach to throw down on the
storming party. This was fortunately ignited by the fire of
the Allied Artillery, and a great explosion followed, killing
many of the French, and producing a disorder which enabled
the troops to establish themselves on the curtain, which they
fought from traverse to traverse. Some additional troops
having entered the town by another breach near the Towers,
the curtain was abandoned, and the fighting confined to the
streets; but very soon the French were driven into the
castle, which alone remained in their hands at the end of
the day. The Allies lost 500 killed, and 1500 wounded in
this assault.</p>

<p>To ensure the surrender of the castle, a bombardment
from mortars was kept up, until two batteries were made
ready in the left attack (Nos. 9 and 10), which were
armed with 17 24-pounders,&mdash;and 2 24-pounders with 1
8-inch howitzer, respectively. No. 9 was to breach the
Mirador and Battery de la Reyna, and No. 10 to operate
against the lower defences of the castle, and to enfilade the
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Dickson
to D.-A.-G.
dated
12 Sept.
1813.</span>
back of the hill. On the morning of the 8th September, the
preparations being complete, the whole of the batteries opened
on the castle. Colonel Dickson describes the bombardment as
having been conducted in beautiful style, and carried on so
vigorously, that in two hours the enemy hoisted a flag of
truce. Sir J. Jones says that the fire was so extremely
rapid and well directed, and of so overpowering a nature,
that the castle scarcely returned a single shot. The terms
of the capitulation having been agreed to, two batteries of
the castle were delivered up the same evening, and on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
next day the garrison marched out with the honours of
war, and laid down their arms. Colonel Dickson was one
of the three officers detailed to arrange the terms of the
capitulation.</p>

<p>The sufferings of the garrison, and of the prisoners in the
castle, during the bombardment, were excessive, as may
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Dickson

readily be imagined when one learns that “they had not a
bomb-proof in it except for powder.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>The siege of San Sebastian has an especial interest for the
Royal Artillery,&mdash;more especially for that part of the
Regiment, the duties of which are confined to the use of
heavy ordnance. This episode was selected by an able and
dispassionate historian, as one reflecting especial honour on
<span class="sidenote">Gleig’s
‘Military
History.’</span>
the Corps. “It offers,” he wrote, “an example of precision
of aim, and absolute coolness on the part of the gunners,
never surpassed.... Such services as these were rendered
thirty years ago by no other artillery in the world; and
as the same spirit still prevails, which prevailed then, in
the magnificent corps of which we are speaking, it cannot
be doubted but that when the opportunity offers again,
they will prove themselves worthy of the renown that
attaches to them.”</p>

<p>These words corroborate what has been so frequently
urged in this work, that a regimental history differs essentially
in its aim from all others. The glow, which it
endeavours to throw over past events, is not meant to
conceal defects, or to distort facts, but to awaken the spirit
of emulation;&mdash;the boastful way in which special honours are
recounted, and distinctive triumphs sung, is not egotistical
pride, or aggressive conceit, but merely the fond treasuring
of a glory which has been gained by others, and transmitted
to their successors for safe keeping;&mdash;and the anxious gleaning
among the fields of former action is but to find herbs, which in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
times of peace shall brace the gleaner for coming days of
work or danger. The more truly a soldier knows and
values the deeds and honours of those who have gone before
him in his corps,&mdash;the more certain will he be to emulate
them. There is no jealousy of the dead. Admiration of
their qualities passes unconsciously into a love for their
memories; and this love inspires a longing not to be
unworthy. It may seem to some but a poor ambition, to
use the weapons well which have been given to us,&mdash;to
sacrifice one’s will unmeaningly,&mdash;and never to be downcast
by discomfort or failure; but it is the highest ambition to
which a soldier can aspire. Nor is it easy for him to
conceive a higher. Cheerful obedience and conscientious
zeal imply most of the higher qualities of humanity; and a
perfect soldier must possess both. The great poet of
England in these days has been the noblest preacher, to
whom her army has ever listened. As he places before his
readers the ideal of a true knight, the soldier sees a standard
which he should never cease to gaze upon. He sees, it may
be for the first time, that opposite virtues should not rebel,
but mingle; and that such should be found in himself as

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">

<span class="i1">And loving, utter faithfulness in love,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And uttermost obedience to the king.”<br /></span>
</span></span>

And, once realising this,&mdash;with the knowledge, possibly, in
his heart that there have been in his corps before him
men who approached even the standard of Arthur’s knights,&mdash;he
must, as he reads of their deeds, long

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> absence of Colonel Dickson from the head-quarters of
the army during the sieges of San Sebastian has had
the effect of leaving the Artillery share in the operations
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Dickson

known as the battle of the Pyrenees, unwritten. He did
not rejoin head-quarters until the 17th September, 1813:
the period, therefore, between the battle of Vittoria and
that date is, as far as the operations of Lord Wellington’s
army are concerned, almost ignored in his correspondence.
In the chapter on the Old Tenth Battalion, in this volume,
some allusion to the services of the Artillery at this time
will be found; and one or two facts are mentioned in
Sir Hew Ross’s memoir; but, really, the chief work fell upon
the Infantry during these operations. Soult had been sent to
take command of the army of Spain, with orders to assume
the offensive at once; which he did, with the ostensible
<span class="sidenote">Lord
Wellington
to Lord
Bathurst,
1 Nov.
1813.</span>
view of relieving the blockade of Pampeluna. This he
failed to do, and that city ultimately surrendered on the
31st October, 1813, relieving Lord Wellington of a great
drag on his movements. The mountainous country, in which
the combats which constituted the battle of the Pyrenees
were fought, was unsuited to the movements of Artillery;
<span class="sidenote">‘Memoirs
of Sir H.
Ross,’
p. 45.</span>
and the Chestnut Troop, which may be taken as a sample of
those engaged, had its carriages completely shaken to pieces.
Soult, having failed to relieve Pampeluna, made an attempt
to raise the siege of San Sebastian; and, on the very day
when the city was stormed, the 31st August, he attacked
the Spanish forces on San Marcial for this purpose, but was
defeated with loss. The conduct of the Spanish on this
occasion was much commended by Lord Wellington; and it
was a singular and happy coincidence that this engagement,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
<span class="sidenote">To Lord
Bathurst,
dated
2 Sept.
1813.</span>
so creditable to the Spanish troops, was the last fought on
Spanish soil. Soult withdrew his forces across the frontier,
and assumed the defensive. For six weeks Lord Wellington
remained inactive, pending intelligence from the Allies in
the north, who were then concentrating their forces against
Napoleon, and would shortly demand from Lord Wellington
a diversion in the south.</p>

<p>During these six weeks, much was done to render the
equipment of the Artillery suitable for a rough and winter
campaign; measures were taken to expedite the arrival,
from Lisbon, of some additional horses which had been sent
from England; and, in the meantime, the troops and
<span class="sidenote">To D.-A.-G.
dated
3 Oct.
1813.</span>
brigades were, as Colonel Dickson wrote, “kept above
water” by the purchase of mules and French horses.</p>

<p>On the 7th October, Lord Wellington made a forward
movement into France by crossing the Bidassoa. This has
always been considered one of the ablest movements made
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Dickson
to D.-A.-G.
dated
10 Oct.
1813.</span>
by the great English General. The passage was effected as
follows. The 5th Division and two 9-pounder brigades forded
at Fuentarabia. The 1st Division, and General Wilson’s
brigade, with one 9-pounder brigade, and Webber Smith’s
Troop of Horse Artillery, crossed at Irun; the Artillery
of this column being commanded by Major Dyer. The
passage of the 1st Division column was covered by the 18-pounder
brigade and a troop of Horse Artillery. General
Freire’s Galician army passed at two fords higher up,
covered by a 9-pounder brigade, Bull’s troop of Horse
Artillery, and a brigade of Spanish Artillery. The passage
of the river was effected, and the French position carried
with great ease. The most difficult duty fell upon the
Spaniards, who behaved well. The French, on the other
hand, behaved ill. The 18-pounder brigade was especially
useful in covering the passage of the troops.</p>

<p>The attack upon the Puerto de Vera was made by the
Light Division and General Giron’s Spanish reserve army,
supported by the 4th Division, who were successful in getting
possession of the pass and adjoining heights; but not until the
9th October did the French quit the Montagne de la Rhune.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span></p>

<p>The night prior to the crossing of the Bidassoa had been
very stormy, and aided in concealing the movements of the
Allies. But Soult never imagined such a thing possible as
<span class="sidenote">Cust.</span>
“the astonishing hardihood of passing columns by fords
where the tide rose 16 feet, and where the sands were
half a mile broad, to force such a river as the Bidassoa at
its mouth.” In his description of the crossing of the
Bidassoa, Sir Augustus Frazer mentions that, when he
reached Irun with Ramsay’s troop and Michell’s (late
Parker’s) brigade, he found 400 Infantry waiting to pull
the guns over the mountain to the places from which they
<span class="sidenote">‘Frazer’s
Letters,’
p. 290.</span>
were to cover the crossing of the army. “But,” he adds
with pride, “<i>Bull’s (Ramsay’s) horses never want assistance</i>;
they were soon posted on a height with some Spanish
<span class="sidenote">Dated
Vera,
10 Oct.
1813.</span>
“Horse Artillery.” From a subsequent official return to
the Master-General, it appears that the 9-pounder brigade
which accompanied the 1st Division was Captain Dansey’s;
and that the 9-pounder brigade which accompanied the 5th
Division was Lawson’s, commanded by the 2nd Captain,&mdash;Mosse.
Captain Morrison still commanded the 18-pounder
brigade; and Lieut.-Colonel Ross’s troop of Horse Artillery
was held in reserve, moving from one point to another
as most required. Including Major Arriaga’s Portuguese
brigade, and the other troops and brigade already mentioned,
there were 48 British and Portuguese guns engaged
at the passage of the Bidassoa; and the Master-General was
informed that the fire of the Artillery on the occasion was
well directed, and that the exertions made by the officers in
bringing forward their respective brigades to the point of
attack were most satisfactory. Lieut.-Colonel May was
Assistant Adjutant-General to the Artillery, Lieutenant Ord
was Brigade-Major, and Lieutenant Pascoe Adjutant. Lieut.-Colonel
Hartmann was in charge of the artillery in position,
and Lieut.-Colonel Frazer and Major Dyer superintended the
bringing forward of the guns.</p>

<p>Further inaction followed the passage of the Bidassoa, until
the fall of Pampeluna, already mentioned, set Lord Wellington
free for a further advance. During this time, attempts were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Dickson
to D.-A.-G.
dated
17 Oct.
1813.</span>
made to supply mountain batteries for the coming service.
Marshal Beresford brought a few 3-pounders from Lisbon;
but it was found almost impossible to procure mules for them.
Three guns of the same calibre, which had been taken from
the French, had been temporarily equipped for single
draught, and placed under the command of Lieutenant Robe,
the son of the gallant officer who commanded at Roliça and
Vimiera. This young officer subsequently fell at Waterloo,
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
24 Oct.
1813.</span>
having seen more battles than years. A medley equipment
was found for the guns brought from Lisbon,&mdash;the Artillerymen
being Portuguese, but the drivers and mules being
British. These guns were carried on the backs of the
mules, and three of them were added to Lieutenant Robe’s
command. A detachment for rocket-service was also sent
from England, but received by Lord Wellington with very
mixed feelings, as he had rather a horror of the rocket as
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
31 Oct.
1813.</span>
a weapon of war. The Chestnut Troop and Douglas’s and
Sympher’s field brigades were also got over the mountains to
Vera, for outpost duty, and to be in readiness to support the
attack on the enemy’s position, which Lord Wellington had
decided to make as soon as Pampeluna should surrender.
The difficulty in getting these guns over was very great, and
was aggravated by the tempestuous weather which prevailed;
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
7 Nov.
1813.</span>
but it was effected without accident. When the news arrived
from Pampeluna, which should have set the army free for
forward movement into France, the weather had become
such that movement was impossible. At Roncesvalles, the
fall of snow was so heavy and unexpected, that three of
Captain Maxwell’s guns had to be abandoned in a redoubt,&mdash;the
guns being buried under ground and the carriages concealed
under the snow. Ross’s, Douglas’s, and Sympher’s
guns had, however, been advanced still farther to support
in the meditated attack on the position of Sarre; Robe’s
mountain guns were attached to the 6th Division, and the
Portuguese 3-pounders to the Light Division and Giron’s
army; while no fewer than 54 guns had been attached to
the left of the army under Sir John Hope,&mdash;Colonel Hartmann
being in command. It will thus be seen that all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
necessary arrangements had been made, as far as the Artillery
department was concerned.</p>

<p>The attack&mdash;which is known as the battle of La Nivelle&mdash;took
place on the 10th November, and resulted in the

from St. Jean de Luz to the front of the Puerto de Maia;

<p>There was also a brigade of Spanish Artillery with General
Freire’s army.</p>

<p>The Artillery with Sir John Hope’s column was but little
engaged, as its advance depended on the success of the
right; but it kept up a heavy and successful cannonade, and
met with a few casualties. The Artillery on the right, in
support of the attack on the redoubts, was, however, of
essential service; and was skilfully handled by the field
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
officers in charge, Lieut.-Colonels Frazer and Buckner.
They opened a vigorous fire on the first redoubt, while the
4th Division was moving forward to assault it, and the effect
of the fire was such as to compel the enemy to abandon the
redoubt without waiting for the assault. At this time the
Chestnut Troop distinguished itself especially. “I must
particularly notice,” wrote Colonel Dickson, “the gallant
manner in which Lieut.-Colonel Ross’s troop was moved
to an advanced position, when it reopened its fire at the
distance of 350 yards from the work, and covered the
approach of the others. In this operation Lieutenant
Day was severely wounded.” As soon as the enemy
quitted the first redoubt, the guns moved forward to support
the 7th Division in the attack of the second, but after a few
rounds it also was abandoned. In the subsequent operations
on the right, the Artillery were unable to take much part, on
<span class="sidenote">Cust.</span>
account of the difficulty in moving the guns. The frightful
state of the roads also aided the ultimate escape of the enemy
without pursuit. To use Sir Augustus Frazer’s words, the
<span class="sidenote">Frazer’s
‘Letters,’
p. 342.</span>
ground over which the battle of La Nivelle was fought was
“so rugged, that it would be difficult to attempt a sketch
of it. You must fancy rocks, and hills, and woods, and
mountains, interspersed with rough heaths and rivers, and
everything but plain ground.” The casualties in the
Artillery were as follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span></div>

<p>The entire losses of the Allies at La Nivelle amounted to
2694 killed and wounded. The conduct of the Artillery
during the battle was such as to excite the following comments:
<span class="sidenote">Frazer’s
‘Letters,’
p. 335.</span>
“Flattering compliments were paid by all on the
undoubted service of the three batteries of Artillery on
<span class="sidenote">Official
Despatch,
14 Nov.
1813.</span>
this occasion, i.e. the attack on the redoubts.” “I beg
you will further state to the Master-General,” wrote
Colonel Dickson, “that I have every reason to be satisfied
with the conduct of all the field officers, officers, non-commissioned
officers, and men, employed on this occasion;
as also of Lieut.-Colonel May, and the officers of the Artillery
Staff.” In his private letter to General Macleod,
Colonel Dickson wrote: “The attack of the first redoubt at
Sarre it was expected would be a very obstinate operation,
and for that reason all the eighteen guns were
brought up against it; however, their fire was so active
and well directed, and Frazer pushed the guns up so close,
<span class="sidenote">Dated
St. Jean
de Luz,
21 Nov.
1813.</span>
that the enemy could not stand it.” In another report,
Colonel Dickson said that the mountain guns under Lieutenant
Robe, and the Portuguese guns of similar calibre,
were most active and useful, accompanying their respective
corps during the day, and supporting the advance of their
<span class="sidenote">Major
Dyer to
Lieut.-Col.
Hartmann,
12 Nov.
1813.</span>
light troops. Captain Ramsay’s troop and Captain Carmichael’s
brigade, with Sir J. Hope’s force, were especially
mentioned;&mdash;the former for having repeatedly silenced the
guns opposed to him, and dismounted one in the redoubt in
front of the 12th and 16th Dragoons; and the latter for
having repeatedly driven back the enemy’s skirmishers,
silenced their guns, and dismounted one in the redoubt
opposite the 1st German Regiment of Infantry. Lord Wellington,
<span class="sidenote">To Lord
Bathurst,
dated
St. Pé,
13 Nov.
1813.</span>
in his despatch, said: “The artillery which was in
the field was of great use to us; and I cannot sufficiently
acknowledge the intelligence and activity with which it
was brought to the point of attack, under the direction of
Colonel Dickson, over the bad roads through the mountains,
at this season of the year.”</p>

<p>The success of the Allies on the right obliged the enemy
to abandon the works at St. Jean de Luz, but any further
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
immediate advance was forbidden to Lord Wellington by the
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Dickson
to D.-A.-G.

1813.</span>
incessant rain which fell for some days. During this period
of compulsory inactivity, every endeavour was made to generate
confidence among the French inhabitants, and although
rendered difficult by the irregularities committed by the
Allied troops, the attempts were ultimately successful.
Writing on the 5th December, 1813, Colonel Dickson, after
his usual announcement that it had never ceased raining,
and that the country was quite impassable, went on to
say: “The inhabitants continue to return to their homes,
and we are the best friends possible.” The dulness of the
weather at St. Jean de Luz, and the inactivity which
Colonel Dickson abhorred, were cheered by an announcement
that the Portuguese Government had been pleased to
promote him to the rank of Colonel in their service, in recognition
of his recent services.</p>

<p>The weather having at length sufficiently moderated to
admit of further operations in the field, Lord Wellington
forced the passage of the Nive at Ustaritz and Cambo, on
the 9th December, with the view of extending his right
towards the Adour. On the 10th, Soult made an attack on
<span class="sidenote">MS.
Return
to the
Master-General,
dated
15 Dec.
1813.</span>
the Allies’ left, near Biarritz, and on the Light Division near
Arcangues; but he failed in both. The services on this
occasion of Captain Ramsay’s troop, and of a division of
Captain Mosse’s brigade, were very conspicuous. A similar
attempt was made on the 11th, in which the French were
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Dickson
to General
Macleod,
dated
15 Dec.
1813.</span>
again repulsed; Captain Ramsay’s troop, and the whole of
Captain Mosse’s brigade, again rendering most valuable
assistance in the defence of the position. Marshal Soult,
being thus disappointed in his hopes of making an impression
on the Allied left, drew the greater part of his force back
to Bayonne on the night of the 12th December, and in the
early morning of the 13th, made a determined attack with
great force on Sir Rowland Hill’s corps, which was in
position on the right of the Nive. His attempts were,
however, vigorously repulsed, and he had eventually to
retire into his entrenched camp, with great loss. The
Artillery with Sir Rowland Hill consisted of the Chestnut
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
Troop and Colonel Tulloh’s Portuguese brigades. With
reference to their conduct, Colonel Dickson wrote: “Nothing
could be stronger than the manner in which Sir Rowland
expressed to me his satisfaction at the conduct of both
these corps.” Colonel Tulloh was wounded on this occasion.
At the same time as the passage of the Nive was
forced, Sir John Hope’s corps on the left reconnoitred
Bayonne. General Hay, who commanded the 5th Division
with this corps, wrote as follows with reference to two guns
of Captain Ramsay’s troop, which were attached to him.
<span class="sidenote">General
Hay to
Colonel
Dickson,
dated
12 Dec.
1813.</span>
“I take the first spare moment to mention to you how
much I was pleased, on the 9th instant, with the very
gallant, zealous, and skilful conduct of Captain Cator, who
commanded two guns of Captain Ramsay’s troop of Horse
Artillery attached to me on that day, which were of the
greatest use in assisting me to dislodge a very superior
body of the enemy opposed to me.”</p>

<p>The attacks made on the 13th by Soult were admirably
planned, but the dogged courage of the five Infantry brigades,
which was the whole force which Sir Rowland Hill had at
first to oppose to him, was invincible. Although driven
back into his intrenchments, his position was one which
was most objectionable to the Allies. His attacks were like
<i>sorties</i> from a fortress,&mdash;which he could make in great force
upon any point, and if he failed, his retreat was short and
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Dickson
to D.-A.-G.
15 Dec.
1813.</span>
easy. It was resolved, therefore, to strengthen the position
occupied by the Allies,&mdash;to fortify one or two salient points,&mdash;and
to place some guns of position. The army then went
into cantonments,&mdash;the Spaniards recrossing the Bidassoa
for that purpose,&mdash;but, as may be imagined, winter quarters
in front of an enemy, known to be very active, did not
conduce to any sense of repose among the commanders.
The conduct of the Artillery at the action of the 13th December
<span class="sidenote">To Lord
Bathurst,
14 Dec.
1813.</span>
was thus noticed by Lord Wellington: “The British
Artillery under Lieut.-Colonel Ross, and the Portuguese
Artillery under Colonel Tulloh, distinguished themselves.”
In the same despatch, the name of Norman Ramsay appears,
as having been favourably mentioned by Sir John Hope.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
Like that brave General, Ramsay had also been twice
wounded during the operations on the Nive.</p>

<p>During the few weeks which preceded the resumption of
hostilities in 1814, the mortality among the Artillery horses
exceeded anything that had yet been witnessed.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> An accident,
which occurred to a supply sent from England to
reinforce them, by which many were killed on board the
transports during a storm, was particularly ill-timed. And,
to crown the evil, Lord Wellington, having decided on the
passage of the Adour, ordered the pontoon train to be increased,
and horsed without delay. There was no alternative
but to take the horses from one of the Artillery brigades;
and the unfortunate Captain Cairnes was again the victim.
Luckily for him, the promotions consequent on the formation
of the Rocket troops had just been notified from
England; and as Norman Ramsay received his promotion
to the rank of 1st Captain, and returned to England, the
command of his troop was given to Captain Cairnes.</p>

<p>The movements in the spring of 1814 were important,
and on a considerable scale. In the end of January, the
enemy showed considerable activity on the Adour, and fitted
out several gun-boats to keep the navigation open, and to
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Dickson

1814.</span>
annoy the posts of the Allies. Against these Lieutenant
Robe’s mountain brigade was first employed, but it was
soon found necessary to supplement it with guns of a heavier
calibre. But in the following month, a change in the
weather&mdash;from rain to frost&mdash;induced Lord Wellington to
commence the execution of operations, which he had been
quietly designing for some weeks. These included the passage
of the Adour near its mouth,&mdash;a feat deemed by Soult impossible,&mdash;and
a simultaneous attack on the left of the
French army to conceal his real intention from Soult.
Colonel Dickson was sent to assist Sir John Hope in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
former operation, which the reader knows was well and skilfully
executed. While the covering fire of the Artillery at
the passage of the Adour was generally effective, that of the
now famous 18-pounder brigade was especially so. Lord
Wellington superintended the operations on the right; and
as his numbers were now superior to his enemy’s, he was
able without risk to carry out both parts of his scheme at
the same time, and to drive Soult’s forces back from their
position. The various operations, which culminated in the
battle of Orthes, are too long to reproduce in a work of this
description; suffice it to give an account of the services of
the Artillery at that great battle. Colonel Dickson being
away, the command of the Artillery with the right of the
army fell to Major Carncross. Colonel Frazer had been
ordered to go with Sir John Hope’s army to the Adour, in
charge of Captain Lane’s rocket detachments, which did
good service during the passage of the river. It may here
be mentioned, that during the operations prior to the investment
of Bayonne, which followed the passage of the Adour,
Colonel Frazer was wounded. Although, however, Major
Carncross was senior officer of Artillery on the field, yet,
being with Sir Howland Hill’s column, he did not participate
in the action so much as Major Dyer, who was with Marshal
Beresford’s column, and from whose reports the services of the
various batteries can more readily be traced. On the morning
of the 27th February, the 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, and light
<span class="sidenote">Major

divisions of Infantry, Colonel Vivian’s and Lord Edward
Somerset’s brigades of Cavalry, Ross’s and Gardiner’s troops
of Horse Artillery, and Maxwell’s, Sympher’s, Turner’s (late
Douglas’s), and Michell’s brigades of Field Artillery, had
crossed the river Pau, over which a pontoon bridge had been
placed during the night. Colonel Ross was no longer with
<span class="sidenote">‘Memoirs

Ross,’
p. 55.</span>
the Chestnut Troop, he having returned to England on leave,
and given the command to his 2nd Captain, Major Jenkinson.
The enemy was found to be in full force on a strong

height near the villages of St. Marie and St. Boe’s, and his
left covering Orthes, and the fords between Depart and Biron.
The battle commenced early in the day, and ended after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
severe fighting, and a loss to the Allies of 2200 killed and
wounded, in the total defeat of the French, with a loss,
which&mdash;if the numerous deserters be included, who came
<span class="sidenote">‘Cust’s
Annals.’</span>
over afterwards&mdash;has been estimated at no fewer than
14,000. Although the verdict of Lord Wellington might
<span class="sidenote">Despatch
to Lord
Bathurst,
dated

satisfy the most fastidious Artilleryman, “The conduct of
the Artillery throughout the day deserved my entire approbation,”&mdash;a
few extracts from the correspondence of
the officers present at the battle cannot fail to be interesting;&mdash;and
the opinions of Generals of division must be
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Dickson

deemed valuable. Taking the latter first, it is recorded that
Sir Thomas Picton expressed himself in terms of the highest
praise with reference to Captain Turner’s brigade; and Sir
Lowry Cole did the same in regard to Major Sympher’s.
The last-named officer, who had done such good and continuous
service in the Peninsular War, was killed at Orthes,
at the very commencement of the action. Major Jenkinson
wrote in general terms, that “all the General Officers speak
in high terms of the services of Ross’s and Gardiner’s troops,
as also of poor Sympher’s brigade.” Major Dyer, in his
<span class="sidenote">To Colonel
Dickson,
dated
3 March,
1814.</span>
report, wrote: “I had the satisfaction about one o’clock to
get Lieut.-Colonel Ross’s and Gardiner’s troops of Horse
Artillery, and the German brigade of Artillery attached
to the 4th Division, into position opposite the enemy’s
strongest columns: the fire from their guns was tremendous,
and, being admirably served, soon caused the enemy
to retire. The brigades then took up separate positions
and annoyed the enemy. About 4 o’clock the guns ceased
firing, the enemy retreating in great confusion, leaving
some pieces of cannon on the field. I have to regret the
loss of Major Sympher and many valuable Artillerymen.”
<span class="sidenote">Dated
3 March,
1814.</span>
In his official report to Marshal Beresford, Major Dyer
wrote: “I should really feel that I omitted a duty imposed
upon me if I did not recommend to your Excellency’s
notice the conduct of Major Sympher, Major Gardiner,
and Major Jenkinson on that brilliant day.” Captain
Beane’s troop of Horse Artillery was with Sir Rowland
Hill’s force, under Major Carncross; and that officer was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
<span class="sidenote">Major
Carncross
to Colonel
Dickson,
dated

1814.</span>
able to speak with pride of the steady, well-directed, and
destructive fire kept up by it, although exposed to a very
severe fire of musketry. On the 2nd March, Sir Rowland
Hill’s force came up with the enemy, and Captain Beane’s
troop performed services for which it was specially mentioned
in orders. Four guns belonging to it were brought into
action with great effect; and one of them, under Lieutenant
Brereton, after a few rounds, silenced two of the enemy’s,
and forced them to retire. On this day, Captain Macdonald,
of Captain Beane’s troop, distinguished himself in
leading on the Portuguese troops, who had been forced back;
and received Sir Rowland Hill’s thanks in public orders on
the following day. Sir Rowland took the opportunity of
assuring Major Carncross that, on the several occasions on
which the troop had been recently engaged, he had been
much satisfied with the officers, non-commissioned officers,
and men composing it.</p>

<p>A period of inactivity followed the battle of Orthes; and
not until April did Wellington resume active operations;
but in the meantime Marshal Beresford, with a considerable
force, proceeded to Bordeaux, and was received with great
delight. Louis XVIII. was proclaimed, and the badges of
the Empire were doffed by the magistrates. During this
time Colonel Dickson’s life had become a burden to him.
Innumerable accidents and delays occurred to the horses
which were on the way to reinforce his brigades; and at
the same time the drain on his resources to meet the wants
<span class="sidenote">To D.-A.-G.
dated
2 April,
1814.</span>
of the pontoon train daily increased. “The pontoon equipment,”
he wrote, “has become such a <i>sink</i> of horses under
the stupidity, inability, and inactivity of the Driver officers,
that I have been obliged, in consequence of the continued
observations of Lord Wellington, to place Artillery officers
to superintend the care of the horses, until the arrival of
the Alicante army, when officers and men of the Royal
Artillery are to be posted to the pontoon train, by which
the bridge department will revert to the Corps it always
belonged to. The bad state of the concern in its mode
of organization enabled me to convince his Lordship of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
the benefit that would arise by having it under one head
and managed by the same officers. <i>He was ignorant of its
having formerly been an Artillery concern; and he added
that he did not know how it had got into the hands of the
Engineers at first.</i>”</p>

<p>To return, however, to the movements of the army. Marshal
Soult, having learnt what had taken place at Bayonne,
commenced to retire upon Toulouse, and Wellington followed
<span class="sidenote">Cust.</span>
in pursuit, but very leisurely. The Allies had 40,000
bayonets and 60 guns to oppose to Soult’s 28,000 and
38 guns; but a reinforcement was expected by the latter in
the shape of Suchet’s army from the east of Spain; and the
position at Toulouse, on which he was retreating had been
strengthened by gradual intrenchments during the past few
weeks. In the commencement of Soult’s retreat, one or two
smart actions had taken place between divisions of the Allies
and the French, but without any result other than perhaps
increasing the rapidity of Soult’s movements. Toulouse was
an important strategic post for the French; it commanded the
passage of the Garonne; a number of roads met there, which
would enable Soult to carry out many different schemes;
and it was the chief military arsenal in the south of France.
Here, if ever, something might be done to benefit the fast-failing
fortunes of the French Emperor, whom the Allies in
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Dickson to
D.-A.-Gen.
13 April,
1814.</span>
the north were hunting relentlessly to his doom. When
Wellington reached the Garonne, his first intention was to
cross it above Toulouse; but this was found so difficult that
the idea was given up, and a flank march having been made on
the 3rd April to a convenient situation about a mile above Grenade,
and below Toulouse, the pontoon bridge was laid early
in the morning of the 4th, and three divisions (the 3rd, 4th,
and 6th) with their artillery, as also six regiments of Cavalry
with Major Gardiner’s troop of Horse Artillery, crossed without
opposition. During this operation, however, the river rose
considerably, owing to the rains which had fallen during the
previous night; and at last the further passage of troops was
suspended. Heavy rain fell again on the night of the 4th, and
the river increased so much that the pontoons were obliged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
to be drawn into the banks, and the army was thus divided
into two parts. Strangely enough, Marshal Soult did not
avail himself of this circumstance, although it was the
morning of the 8th before the river was sufficiently low
to admit of the bridge being relaid. The Spanish corps,
Colonel Arentschild’s Portuguese Artillery, and the head-quarters
staff passed over on that day. The bridge was
then moved a little farther up the river, and early on the
<span class="sidenote">MS. Official

morning of the 10th April the Light Division crossed. On
this day was fought the battle of Toulouse. The offensive
was taken by Lord Wellington, who attacked a strong position
which the enemy had fortified to cover the city of
Toulouse, and succeeded in obtaining entire possession of it
after an obstinate resistance. In consequence of this defeat,
Soult evacuated Toulouse during the night of the 11th,
retiring by the route to Carcassone. The distribution and
services of the Artillery of the Allies were as follows. The
Portuguese Artillery, consisting of ten 9-pounder guns,
under Colonel Arentschild, covered the attack made by the
Spaniards on the left of the enemy’s position. This Artillery
was warmly engaged during the best part of the day, and
distinguished itself greatly by its firmness and correct firing.
A German brigade, under Captain Daniel, and Captain
Brandreth’s 9-pounder brigade, both under Major Dyer,
were for some time employed in covering the movements of
Marshal Beresford’s column in its attack on the right of the
position; and on that being carried, they moved up to higher
ground, and assisted in taking the remainder of the position,
and also in moderating the fire of the enemy from the opposite
side of the canal, across which the French were ultimately
driven. The enemy’s fire from that point had greatly annoyed
the Allies; and Colonel Dickson expressed himself
highly satisfied with the counter-effect produced by the fire
of Captain Brandreth’s and Captain Daniel’s guns.</p>

<p>Major Gardiner’s troop of Horse Artillery was at first
employed in supporting the left of the Spanish attack, and
afterwards moved to the ridge carried by Marshal Beresford,
where Colonel Dickson reported that it was “of infinite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
service.” While these operations were going on, the 3rd
and Light Divisions were employed in threatening the
enemy’s position along the canal, towards the point where
it joined the Garonne. In this service, Captain Turner’s
(late Douglas’s) brigade was engaged. Captain Bean’s troop
and Captain Maxwell’s brigade (now No. 4 Battery, 7th
Brigade) were on the opposite side of the river with Sir
Rowland Hill’s corps, engaged in the attack made upon the
tête de pont. The officers on the Staff of the Artillery at the
battle of Toulouse were Lieut.-Colonel May, Lieut.-Colonel
Frazer, and Lieutenants Ord and Bell. From these officers
Colonel Dickson reported that he had received every assistance.
<span class="sidenote">MS. Return

The casualties among the Artillery engaged amounted
to 1 officer (Lieutenant Blumenbach, K.G.A., killed) and
58 non-commissioned officers and men killed and wounded.
Among the horses, 28 were killed and 13 wounded. The casualties
among the Royal Horse Artillery engaged amounted
to 8 men and 4 horses; and among the Royal Artillery brigades
to 29 men and 23 horses. The remaining casualties
occurred among the Germans and Portuguese.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Colonel

<p>Early in the morning of the 12th, the Allies took possession
of Toulouse, and the white flag was hoisted. Lord
Wellington was received by the corporation at the Town
Hall, and addressed them, pointing out the necessity of
weighing well the step which they were about to take at a
moment when a congress was possibly sitting, for the purpose
of making peace with Napoleon. <i>Vive le Roi!</i> however, was
heard from every lip, and every one mounted a white
cockade. In the evening of the 12th, a messenger arrived
from Paris with the intelligence of Napoleon’s abdication, and
the restoration of the Bourbons. The intelligence was very
welcome to the inhabitants of Toulouse, who could not but
feel rather nervous after the step which they had taken.
The same messengers carried to Marshal Soult the news of
the Allies entering Paris, and of the official dethronement
of Napoleon by the Senate; but he would give them no
credence. How faithfully Napoleon was served by his Lieutenants,
and how devotedly they clung to his cause, must be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
apparent to the most superficial reader of his history. In him,
who has been called the incarnation of war in all its bad as
well as good attributes, they saw but one who was <i>facile
princeps</i> in the profession which they loved;&mdash;seeing this,
they clung to his cause to the bitter end; and with a
hungering in their hearts for his leadership, even while
serving another prince, they turned to him, after his escape
from Elba, with an enthusiasm more like the love of a woman
than the cold, reasoning affection of a man. Soldiers, indeed,
have many of the qualities of the other sex. Once let them
believe in a leader, and no disasters, no slanders will upset
their creed; and from a leader, whom they love, even many
harsh words will be forgotten in the presence of one word
of kindness. There are those who think that a soldier’s
mind is like a blank page, on which their own views and
wishes may with ease be inscribed. And in one sense they
are right. Let skill and courage once be visible in a commander,
and the obedience and enthusiasm of his men will
be his; but let him supplement these qualities by thoughtful
consideration, by kind words, by ready participation in
hardships, and he will earn from them a love which shall
pass even the love of women. But the kind words will not
win it without the skill, nor the consideration without the
courage.</p>

<p>On Soult’s refusing to credit the intelligence from Paris,
Lord Wellington made arrangements for moving forward
with the army. On the 16th, however, a French officer
arrived from Paris with despatches for Marshal Soult; and
this was followed by an officer arriving from the French
army to treat with Lord Wellington. Had the despatches
but arrived a little sooner, a loss of life would have been
saved at Bayonne. A <i>sortie</i> was made from the city, on the
14th April, which, although unsuccessful, resulted in the
death of General Hay and not a few brave officers, and in
the capture of that most brave and chivalrous leader, Sir
John Hope.</p>

<p>The war was now over; but, before closing this chapter,
let a word be said with reference to the services of an officer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
of the Corps who commanded with distinction the rocket
detachments attached to the Allied army at Leipsic in 1813,
and who met a soldier’s death many years after, at the battle
of Inkermann&mdash;Thomas Fox Strangways. At Leipsic he commanded,
from the circumstance that his Captain, Bogue, fell
early in the day. He was then but a subaltern; but ere he left
the field, at the head of his brigade he received the personal
<span class="sidenote">From a
Letter
written by
Lady Fox
Strangways.</span>
thanks of the Allied sovereigns; and the Emperor of Russia,
taking from his breast the order of St. Anne, placed it upon
that of the young officer whose services had been so eminent
on that day. In recounting the story of the battle, Sir
Edward Cust says that such was the fearful effect of the
rockets, that a whole brigade surrendered after enduring
their fire for a few minutes; and it has also been recorded,
on the best evidence, that, at a most critical time of the
battle, the Crown Prince of Sweden rode up to him, and
implored him to advance his brigade, as nothing else would
save the day. To his exertions at Leipsic was the subsequent
organization of regular rocket troops due; and on this
taking place the command of the brave men, who had distinguished
themselves at Leipsic, passed into the hands of
one both able and brave,&mdash;one who had done noble service in
the Peninsula, which he was to repeat at Waterloo,&mdash;gentle
and yet enthusiastic,&mdash;the late Sir E. C. Whinyates.</p>

<p>In closing this narrative of the services of the Artillery
in the Peninsula, it is impossible to avoid feeling that it has
fallen immeasurably short of the narrative to which these
services are justly entitled. It is felt that the attempt to
place before the reader the chivalry, courage, and endurance
of those who represented the Corps in the great wars with
France, has been defeated by considerations of space, as well
as by the writer’s inexperience. To realise these qualities
thoroughly, it will be necessary for the reader to clothe
these skeleton pages with the noble drapery of Napier.</p>

<p>But if these qualities, which are matter of history, have
failed to receive adequate description, how much greater has
been the shortcoming in endeavouring to picture those
virtues, which can only be detected in the intimacy of private
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
friendship, or the study of private correspondence! It
is only from the latter that the student is now able to see
how almost brotherly was the relationship between the
officers of the Corps in Lord Wellington’s army. For example:&mdash;on
hearing of Colonel Dickson’s promotion by the
Portuguese Government, in the winter of 1813, what were
the words of the man whom he had superseded, and who was
as able as himself? “I wish,” wrote Sir Augustus Frazer,
“that he were a General; he fully deserves all that can be
given him either as honour or reward.” And as he felt, so
did all. In the letters, also, announcing the Artillery losses
at the various battles in that war, of which it has been said
that the Allies “left 40,000 of their own number dead on
<span class="sidenote">Cust.</span>
the plains and mountains of the Peninsula,” how fervently
does the loving, brotherly spirit appear! Each good quality
in the dead is fondly dwelt upon; and as one gazes on the
loving words, written on pages now so faded by hands so
long still, there rises a picture of a Regimental unity which
it were a sacrilege now to disturb by internal differences. It
is, indeed, well at times to close our eyes to the present, and
to look back at the past;&mdash;a standard is often to be found
there which shall dwarf that which we may have set up in
our self-esteem, and thought colossal. Possibly, never in
the whole history of the Regiment has there been a time of
such intellectual life among its members, as at the present
day; but as the great school of experience, which in the
beginning of this century made giants of our Artillerymen,
is not now open, it may be that there is almost a danger
in this mental activity, unless it be tempered by the study of
comrades, who in days gone by were the embodiments of duty,
courage, and hardihood. Thus history may furnish to the
student a stability, which shall allay present restlessness.

<span class="medium smcap">The Second American War.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> Canadian incidents in this war have been glanced at
in the chapter on the Old Tenth Battalion; and the
actions, in which the various Companies were engaged, have
been given in the tables of the Battalions to which they
belonged. No allusion has, however, been yet made to the
disastrous chapter in the history of the war, in which the
scene was laid at New Orleans; and, as the largest Artillery
force together during the campaign was with the army on
that service, it is proposed in this chapter to devote the
chief space to the incidents connected with it.</p>

<p>The story of the second American War may be summarised
as follows. On the 18th June, 1812, the Government of the
United States declared war against Great Britain. It is not
uncharitable to repeat what is matter of history, that the
United States have always found their grievances against
the mother-country more intolerable, when that country
has happened to be engaged in war. It was so in 1812;
and the dream of annexing Canada, which has haunted
American statesmen for nearly a century, seemed likely to
be realised. But, then, as since, the United States underrated
the loyalty of the Canadians; and their attempted
invasion in 1812 proved a ludicrous failure. Their first
<span class="sidenote">Cust.</span>
attempt was made with a force of 2500 men under a
General Hall, who invaded Upper Canada, but was successfully
resisted by a force of Regulars and Militia under a
British General, Brock, and had to retire to the American
side of the St. Lawrence, where he took shelter in Fort
Detroit. Here he was followed by General Brock, to whom
he surrendered on the 16th August. A similar fate awaited
the second attempt made by the United States. A force of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
1400 men, under General Wadsworth, crossed into Canada,
near Niagara, in October 1812. The reception he met was
a warm one; the American fort at Niagara was captured by
the English; and after a few minor operations, in which,
unfortunately, General Brock was killed, the American
General surrendered himself, with 900 men, to General
Sheaffé, who had succeeded to the command on the death
of General Brock. A third invasion, on a larger scale, was
then decided on. One detachment crossed the frontier between
Chippewa and Fort Erie, but was repulsed with loss;
while the main body menaced Montreal. Such, however,
were the preparations made by the English General, Prevost,
at the latter place, that the Americans withdrew into their
own country without an engagement.</p>

<p>The operations during the year 1813 were on a larger
scale, and success was not always on the side of the British.
The year commenced with the defeat of the Americans at
Fort Detroit by a mixed force under Colonel Procter; but
was followed by the capture of York, the capital of Upper
Canada. The lakes became the scene of very active hostilities.
A severe engagement took place at the rapids of
the Miami, a river flowing into Lake Erie, in which the
English were successful, but could not maintain their position.
<span class="sidenote">Russell.</span>
The loss of Fort George, at Niagara, by the English
followed; and this became for a time the American General’s
head-quarters. Disasters on the lakes, which ensued, made
the English position in Upper Canada very feeble; but
affairs brightened in the autumn with the discomfiture of
the Americans in their attempted invasion of Lower Canada.
Operations were therefore ordered to be resumed in the west
with vigour; and it having been found that the Americans
had evacuated Fort George and set fire to many Canadian
villages, the English followed them across the frontier,
and took Fort Niagara and Buffalo, setting fire to the latter
city in retaliation for the injury done to the Canadian
settlements.</p>

<p>The attempts made by the Americans in the beginning of
1814 to invade Lower Canada were so unsuccessful, that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
<span class="sidenote">Cust.</span>
war was now limited to the more western districts, where
they had the advantage on the lakes. The commencement
of the campaign in the west was favourable to the Americans,
but the arrival of reinforcements from the Duke of
Wellington’s army in France speedily gave a change to the
aspect of affairs. While the British troops were retreating
in good order before the Americans, they were joined by
General Drummond, with these fresh troops, and had hardly
formed up before they were attacked by the enemy, and the
combat known as the battle of Lundy’s Lane followed. It
was a very fierce engagement, and lasted till midnight; and
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.</span>
so closely was it fought, that “several of the British Artillerymen
were bayoneted at their guns;” but it ultimately
resulted in the precipitate retreat of the Americans. This
part of the enemy’s force was subsequently cooped up in
Fort Erie, which was invested by General Drummond during
the rest of the war. The strength of the Royal Artillery
<span class="sidenote">Kane’s
List.</span>
in Canada had increased in 1814 to eight companies, under
the command of Major-General Glasgow.</p>

affairs which took place during the war in Canada, hardly
worthy of the name of battles, were as follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It had been decided by the English Government to carry
the war into the enemy’s country in another direction, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
energy of the officer who commanded the expedition against
Washington&mdash;Major-General Ross&mdash;was a marked contrast
to the nervous indecision of Sir George Prevost, in the operations
of the latter against the States from Canada. General
Ross’s force came from France, and the companies of Artillery
were those commanded by Captain&mdash;afterwards Sir
John&mdash;Michell, Captain Carmichael, and Captain Crawford.
Some rocket detachments, under Captain Deacon, formed
part of the force. The engagements in which this army
was engaged were the battle of Bladensburg, the capture
of Washington, and the battle of Baltimore; on all which
occasions&mdash;as in the previous operations in Canada&mdash;the
Artillery earned the commendations of the Generals under
whom they served. In one despatch it was said, that “the
Royal Artillery, in the laborious duties they performed,
displayed their usual unwearied zeal.” It is pleasant to
find how often, in various campaigns, the services of the
Corps are alluded to in almost these words. Courage is
expected from every soldier; but a zeal, which no labour
can weary, is a nobler, and as necessary a quality.</p>

<p>The next episode in the war is one which it is intended
to treat at somewhat greater length,&mdash;the New Orleans expedition.
On the 25th November, 1814, a squadron arrived

from England, with a body of troops under the command of
Major-General Keane, and cast anchor in Negril Bay, Jamaica.
Here the force, lately commanded by General Ross,
who had been killed at the battle of Baltimore, was also
assembled; and General Keane, as senior officer, assumed
command of the whole, viz.<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It will be observed, that the numbers of the 1st West
India Regiment are not given. This is because at the date
of both forces uniting, only seventy men of that Regiment
had yet arrived.</p>

<p>Some modifications in the strength of the Royal Artillery

anticipate matters, and to give now the exact details of the
force as it ultimately stood, on Christmas Day, 1814.</p>

<p>The fleet sailed from Jamaica on the 27th November,
1814, General Keane and the Admiral, Sir A. Cochrane,
having preceded the others to make the necessary arrangements.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir A.
Dickson’s
MSS.</div>

<p>On the 24th December, a frigate from England joined
the fleet, having brought out Major-General Sir Edward
Pakenham, as Commander of the Forces, accompanied by
Colonel Dickson and Colonel Burgoyne, as commanding
officers, respectively, of Artillery and Engineers. On their
arrival they learnt that&mdash;certain difficulties in the way of a
passage to New Orleans through the lakes having been
removed&mdash;the army had landed at a creek at the head of
Lake Borgne on the 24th December. Being very anxious
to join them, Sir Edward Pakenham and his staff pushed on
in a boat without delay, for a distance of forty miles, through
a number of dismal reed-covered islands, reaching the ‘Britannia’
transport at 10 <small>P.M.</small> Here they learnt that General
Keane had landed on the morning of the 23rd with 2000
men at the upper part of a creek called Bayou Catalan, at
the head of Lake Borgne;&mdash;that he had advanced to the bank
of the Mississippi, and on the evening of the same day had
been attacked by a strong force of the enemy, which he
had repulsed, but not without considerable loss;&mdash;that the
army had not yet moved farther forward, but was waiting
for more troops to join,&mdash;only 2000 having been landed at
first, and the remainder having gone up the creek in
schooners, many of which had gone aground. By rowing
all night, and adding thirty miles to the journey already
made, Sir Edward Pakenham and his staff reached the head-quarters
of Sir Alexander Cochrane, which were established
in a few fishermen’s huts,&mdash;the only habitations that existed
for miles round in that most melancholy and unhealthy district.
By 11 <small>A.M.</small> on the 25th December, they succeeded
in reaching the landing-place at the head of the creek; and
ascertaining that the army head-quarters were only 2½ miles
farther on, they proceeded to join them. The road which
they traversed was merely a wretched marshy footpath along
the bank of a little canal or <i>bayou</i>, which extended from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
creek almost to the Mississippi, and was navigable for canoes
to within 1000 yards of that river. On arriving at headquarters,
they found the army on the ground on which they
had fought on the 23rd; the number of men landed having
been increased to 3500. The Artillery, which had been
landed and equipped, was as follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The first duty which Colonel Dickson had to perform was
to place what guns he had in battery, to destroy a 14-gun
corvette, which lay in the Mississippi, and annoyed the camp.
The gallant Colonel had a weakness for hot shot, and having
made the necessary arrangements, placing all his guns on
the levée (as the river embankment was called), except his
3-pounders, which were sent on with the advanced guard, he
opened fire at 8 <small>A.M.</small> on the morning of the 27th December.
He fired hot shot from his 9-pounders and shell from the
other guns. He got the exact range almost at once, and the
practice was excellent. The enemy returned a few random
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
shots, and then the crew made for the shore; and until half-past
10, when the vessel blew up, not another shot was fired
from it. The number of rounds expended in destroying
this corvette was 191.</p>

<p>The army now prepared to advance against New Orleans;
but, from want of horses, Colonel Dickson was obliged to
leave two 6-pounders and a light howitzer behind; and as it
had been resolved to make the ground which was their first
head-quarters a sort of depôt for stores, &amp;c., Captain Crawford
was also left behind to superintend the forwarding of
the necessary ammunition, &amp;c., for the Artillery. The cold
was so intense that the men of the West India Regiments
suffered greatly, many dying from its effects, and all being
more or less torpid. It seems superfluous to inform the
reader that no change had been made in their dress or equipment,
on leaving the West Indies, to prepare them for the
change in temperature and the continued exposure.</p>

<p>On Sir E. Pakenham’s arrival, a rearrangement took place
among the troops of the divisions. Major-General Gibbs
was placed in command of the 4th, 44th, 21st, and 1st West
India Regiments; and Major-General Keane in command of
the 85th, 93rd, 95th, and 5th West India Regiments. The
Artillery was distributed, as follows, for the advance:&mdash;Captain
Deacon’s 3-pounder brigade and half the rocket equipment
under Lieutenant Crawley, were to advance with
General Gibbs’s brigade by a road leading through the fields
to the main piquet-house of the enemy, against which they
were to be employed to drive the enemy from the post, and
to cover the advance of the column. The small mortars,
and the other half of the rocket equipment, under Captain
Lane, were attached to General Keane’s brigade, ordered to
advance by the chief road, running along the bank of the
river. Major Michell’s two 9-pounders and heavy howitzer,
and Captain Carmichael’s two 6-pounders, were to be in
reserve, and to move with General Keane’s column. The
guns left behind with Captain Crawford were placed in
battery on the river, to prevent boats or vessels passing up
or down.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span></p>

<p>On the morning of the 28th December, at daybreak, the
army moved forward; but the results of the day’s operations
were far from favourable. General Gibbs’s column marched
against the enemy’s piquet-house, known as La Ronde’s, and
the 3-pounders and rockets having opened on it, it was soon
evacuated by the American troops. Both columns then
pressed on, and suddenly, at a turn of the road, found themselves
within 700 or 800 yards of the enemy, whose force
was drawn up behind an entrenchment flanked on either side
by the river and a wood. A corvette was at anchor in the
stream, to assist the American troops. A brisk cannonade
was immediately opened against the English, and, although
heartily replied to, the advantages of the enemy’s position
were such that it was found advisable to withdraw to a distance
of about 2200 yards from the enemy’s line, and to take
up a position parallel to that of the Americans, and flanked
by the river and the wood. Captain Carmichael’s 6-pounders
had been disabled by the enemy’s fire, and were therefore
exchanged for those left behind at the depôt. Entrenchments
were thrown up in front of the 9-pounders, and a battery
commenced in which it was proposed to place two 18-pounders
which had been brought from the ships, transported on bullock-waggons
originally intended for the conveyance of sugar
hogsheads. This battery was at the angle of a field adjoining
the high road to New Orleans, which ran parallel to the
river. It was placed under the command of Lieutenant
Speer, with a detachment of twenty gunners; and, as might
have been expected from Colonel Dickson’s well-known
proclivities, it was speedily supplied with the necessary
apparatus for heating shot.</p>

<p>As Sir Edward Pakenham had decided on deferring any
assault on the enemy’s position until some effect had been
produced by heavy artillery, every exertion was used to land
18-pounder guns and 24-pounder carronades from the ships,
and to draw them as far as La Ronde’s house, to remain
there until the batteries should be got ready. Ammunition
was also landed; but it was found necessary to take all the
made cartridges to pieces and make fresh quantities, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
which purpose all the available cotton and sheeting were
taken from the houses in the neighbourhood, and all the
regimental tailors were employed in making cartridges. The
want of any artillery machines for the transport or placing
of heavy ordnance was severely felt; the necessary guns
however having been brought up on the 31st December, and
ammunition having been prepared at the rate of 68 rounds
per gun and 40 for each carronade, Sir Edward Pakenham
directed that batteries should be made and armed that evening,
as follows,&mdash;their position being where the army had
penetrated when the first encounter with the enemy behind
his entrenchments took place&mdash;about 800 yards distant from
the American line<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">1. On the high road, and immediately adjoining the river, two 18-prs.,
with 50 rounds a gun, to fire upon the enemy’s defences on the right:
officer in charge, Captain Lemprière. This battery was the most
advanced of all.</p>

<p class="hang">2. A little in rear, and to the right of No. 1, was a battery of three
5½-inch mortars, with 30 shells each, under Captain Lawrence. A little
in front of this battery, Captain Lane with the rocket battery was
stationed.</p>

<p class="hang">3. To the right of the rocket battery a 7-gun battery was erected for
Major Michell’s two 9-prs. and one heavy howitzer, and Captain
Carmichael’s three 6-pounders (one of the disabled 6-prs. having been
repaired) and his light howitzer. This battery was to be employed
against the enemy’s guns, and the centre of his line.</p>

<p class="hang">4. On the centre road, which was parallel to the river and main road, and
at right angles to the enemy’s entrenchments, there was a 10-gun
battery, consisting of six 18-prs. under Captain Crawford, R.A., and
four 24-pr. carronades under Captain Money, R.N. These guns were
to be employed in the first instance against the enemy’s artillery, and
afterwards to break down the entrenchment a little to the left of the
centre.</p>

<p class="hang">5. To the right of the 10-gun battery was a second rocket battery under
Lieutenant Crawley.</p></blockquote>

<p>As these batteries had to be erected between 8.30 <small>P.M.</small> on
the 31st December, 1814, and 5.45 <small>A.M.</small> on the following day,
they could not be very strong. They were constructed of
sugar casks filled with earth <i>not</i> rammed, one cask in thickness,
and backed up. They were only one cask in height,
and, as the platforms were also a little raised, it followed
that the gunners, when standing erect, were head and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
shoulders above the parapet. The platforms were very ill-laid,
uneven, and unsteady.</p>

<p>The night was very dark, and the working parties were
not collected without much difficulty; but on Sunday morning,
New Year’s Day, 1815, at daylight, all was ready. A
heavy fog, however, came on at 4 o’clock, and not until
9 o’clock was it possible to see the enemy’s works. During
the interval, the columns of Infantry moved to their respective
posts to be in readiness for the assault.</p>

<p>On the fog clearing away, the English batteries opened
vigorously, and at first a little confusion was apparent among
the Americans. This soon disappeared, however; and, as
their batteries were strong, and the embrasures strongly
constructed with cotton bags, they soon served their guns
admirably, and their heavy shot, penetrating the slight
English batteries, caused a considerable number of casualties.
After about three hours’ firing, the ammunition in the
10-gun English battery was nearly exhausted, the 7-field-gun
battery had been silenced, a cheek of the heavy howitzer
carriage was shattered, and several other injuries to the gun-carriage
had been received. The heavy guns had, fortunately,
received no injury; but want of ammunition soon compelled
them to be silent also, to the great delight of the enemy.
Even, however, if the ammunition had not failed, the nature
of the batteries was such that the men could not have gone
on much longer. The Americans fired from ten to twelve
guns in their lines, and from four to five on the other side
of the river, many of them being heavy guns&mdash;32-pounders
and 24-pounders;&mdash;and although several of them had been
dismounted by the fire of the English, the remainder were
as active at the last moment as at any time during the
day. The casualties among the Royal Artillery were as
follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="table">
Lieutenant Alexander Ramsay: mortally wounded.<br />
12 Artillerymen killed.<br />
13 Artillerymen wounded.<br />
</p>

<p>Owing to the uneven and loose state of the platforms, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
ship carriages were found to be very awkward and unmanageable,
so that the fire did not attain the necessary
precision, nor could it be kept up with the rapidity necessary
to silence the enemy’s guns. The carronades recoiled off
the platform every round. The insufficient strength of the
batteries, and the fact of the men being so unprotected, also
tended to make the fire less active, and to prevent its
silencing guns which were protected by good and solid cover.
Colonel Dickson, in his report, said that if he had had heavy
ordnance on proper travelling carriages, he was convinced
that, with the same quantity of ammunition, he would have
silenced or dismounted every gun in the American lines. It
has been urged, and with reason, that it was a mistake to
commence with so small a quantity of ammunition; but it
must be remembered that there was no immediate certainty
of a further supply, and the necessity of doing something
had become every hour more urgent, as the Americans were
busy daily in strengthening their position.</p>

<p>In consequence of the failure on the 1st January, Sir
Edward Pakenham resolved to defer further action until the
arrival of some reinforcements which he knew to be on the
way, and in the meantime to withdraw the guns from the
batteries, and the troops from the advanced position which
they had taken up. The removal of the guns was not
effected without great difficulty. The rain, which was falling
continuously, had made the batteries and roads knee-deep
with mud; but, thanks to the energy of Sir Edward himself,
the whole was effected before daylight on the 2nd.</p>

<p>Although superfluous, it will confirm what has been so
often said in the course of this history, with reference to the
supply department of the Ordnance, if a few words written
by Colonel Dickson be now quoted, with reference to the
expedition against New Orleans, which had begun so unfortunately,
and was to end so disastrously. “With respect,”
he wrote, “to our own ammunition and stores, great quantities
of articles have been sent that are perfectly unnecessary
and never have been demanded, whereas others
greatly required have never been sent, although demanded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
in the most urgent manner.” In this respect the narrative
of the services of the Royal Artillery is singularly
monotonous.</p>

<p>On the 3rd January, General Lambert arrived at head-quarters,
and on the following day the 7th and 43rd Regiments
marched in. The attack, which was now decided upon,
cannot be understood without some preliminary explanation.
It must be borne in mind that the Americans did not content
themselves with remaining idly behind their entrenchments.
They had erected flanking works at each end of
their line, and had also made and armed batteries on the
other side of the river, which were useful both for direct and
enfilade fire. It was therefore resolved to send a column
across the river, to attack and, if possible, capture the
batteries there, prior to the general assault on the enemy’s
main work. To do this it was necessary to obtain boats:
and a canal was dug from the head of the lake to within
a few yards of the river, up which forty-two ships’ boats
were brought, ready to be launched in the river on the night
of the attack. Considerable changes were made in the position
and armament of the English batteries. In order to
support the attack on the other side, the following guns were
placed so as to command the river and fire at the enemy’s
batteries on the right bank<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The batteries against the main entrenchment on the left
bank were two in number, containing four 18-pounders and
four 24-pounders. It was first intended that Captain Michell’s
brigade of heavy howitzers and 9-pounders should be sent
across the river, if the attack on that side should prove successful;
but this plan was subsequently altered, and Captain
Michell’s brigade, with Captain Deacon’s, was employed in
the main attack on the enemy’s line.</p>

<p>The attack took place on the morning of Sunday, the 8th
January. As soon as it was dark on the previous night, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
operation of carrying the boats from the canal to the Mississippi
commenced, but was found to be more difficult than
had been anticipated. There was scarcely any water in the
opening which had been cut in the <i>levée</i>,&mdash;and between that
and the stream the water was shallow, and the mud very deep.
The greater part of the night was spent in getting the boats
afloat. At 3.15 <small>A.M.</small> only thirty boats had been launched into
the deep water, and the 85th Regiment alone had been
embarked. The fatiguing nature of the work passed description,
and the exertions made by all to overcome the difficulties
were beyond praise. Many of the working parties
were obliged to stand in mud which almost reached their
waists; and yet there was not a word of complaint. Had
the determination of the troops in the battle of the 8th been
equal to that displayed on the night preceding, a painful
chapter in English history need never have been written.
The difficulties experienced in getting the force under
Colonel Thornton transported across the river were almost
equalled by those experienced in getting the batteries ready
for the main attack. The ground over which the guns had to
be transported was very heavy, and intersected with ditches:
and at 4.30 <small>A.M.</small> the batteries were not yet half finished.
The reader will bear in mind that it was necessary to defer
the erection and armament of these batteries until the night
preceding the engagement, in order to deceive the enemy.</p>

<p>When Sir Edward Pakenham quitted his quarters at 5 <small>A.M.</small>
on the 8th, he was surprised to hear that Colonel Thornton’s
party had not yet crossed the river; and, as it was so nearly
daylight, he hesitated as to the wisdom of letting them go,
as there would not be time for them to get possession of the
works on the other side, and to bring up artillery to enfilade
the enemy’s line in support of the general attack, which was
to take place at daylight. Still, bearing in mind that, at
the worst, Colonel Thornton’s movements would operate as a
timely diversion, he sent to enquire how many men had been
embarked: and, having been informed that the 85th Regiment,
with some Marines&mdash;amounting in all to 460&mdash;had
been put on board, and that there was room for 100 more,&mdash;he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
ordered that additional number to be embarked, and the
whole to cross without delay.</p>

<p>Too literal obedience to orders is often fatal. Had the
officer superintending the launching of the boats made use
of a smaller number, and made more frequent trips with
them across the river, there is little doubt that he would
easily have succeeded in transporting the whole force in
sufficient time. But, having received orders to launch forty-two
boats, he obeyed his orders to the letter; nor did the
unexpected difficulties which he encountered suggest to him
the propriety of consulting Sir Edward Pakenham, with a
view to modifying his orders, and bringing them into accord
with the altered circumstances. The hurried embarkation
at the end, and the smaller force employed, produced the
alteration already mentioned in the disposition of the Artillery
intended to accompany Colonel Thornton’s force. Major
Michell, without his guns, and Captain Lane’s rocket detachments
alone crossed the river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MS.
Journal of
Sir A.
Dickson.</div>

<p>At 5.30 <small>A.M.</small> Sir Edward proceeded to the front. Colonels
Dickson and Burgoyne followed him; and the description of
the battle may be summarised from the voluminous account
of the former officer. Day was fast breaking, and, as they
passed the house known as La Ronde’s, a rocket was fired,
which, they afterwards learned, was a signal for the advance
of the columns to the attack. They had not proceeded much
farther when the fire of musketry commenced, followed by
that of artillery; and, as they proceeded to a point about
600 yards distant from the enemy’s line, they observed the
reserve troops moving forward by a road on their flank. It
was evident that the attack should have been made a little
earlier in the morning, as the Americans could not have
directed their fire with such certainty against the English
columns, which, as Colonel Dickson rode forward, he perceived
must be distinctly visible from the enemy’s lines. At
first the musketry fire was scattered along the line; it
then became more general, although not so incessant as
might have been expected. The fire of artillery was heavy,
and kept up with the utmost vigour; but as Colonel Dickson
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
advanced, he observed the infantry fire to be slackening,&mdash;heard
that Sir Edward Pakenham was badly wounded,&mdash;and
met the troops coming back in great confusion, the 1st
Brigade, however, which had been in reserve, continuing to
advance in good order. Seeing the field Artillery on his left
slowly retiring, Colonel Dickson rode up, and ascertained
from Captain Carmichael that he had moved forward according
to order, taken up a position, and opened as soon as the musketry
fire commenced; but that he had scarcely fired five
rounds a gun when the attacking columns broke at the head,
and such numbers of men came in front of his guns that he
was obliged to cease firing; and being under a most heavy
fire, without the power of returning it, he had thought it
best to fall back. One 3-pounder gun had been dismounted,
both gun-wheels having been shot away. It was soon apparent
that the attack had entirely failed; but the sight of
the 1st Brigade continuing to advance, and the 2nd commencing
to re-form, gave some hopes of its renewal. These
were, however, soon dissipated; the artillery and musketry
fire of the enemy continued unslackened; and the 1st
Brigade, followed by the other troops, was soon observed to
move to the right towards the wood, and to lie down under
cover. During the whole of these events, the fire from the
Royal Artillery batteries, under Major Munro, was kept up
with the greatest vigour. Colonel Dickson then moved the
brigades of Artillery, and formed line for action on the road.
While doing this, he heard that both General Gibbs and
<span class="sidenote">MS.
Journal of
Sir A.
Dickson.</span>
General Keane were wounded,&mdash;the former mortally. “A
little afterwards,” he wrote, “I heard of the death of Sir
Edward Pakenham, who perished in a noble effort to re-establish
the confidence of the troops, which had halted
from panic just as they were arriving at the line of the
enemy,&mdash;a panic which no exertion could restore, and
which occasioned their total repulse and defeat. Major
Macdougal, Sir Edward’s aide-de-camp, informed me that
at the moment the column of General Gibbs’ brigade
stopped they began firing front and rear, and Sir Edward,
who was at some distance behind to observe the operation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
immediately galloped up to the head of the column,
exclaiming, ‘Lost from want of courage!’ and was trying
to encourage the troops on, which he succeeded in doing
for a few yards, when he was wounded in the thigh, and
his horse killed. Major Macdougal having extricated and
raised him from the ground, he was in the act of mounting
Macdougal’s horse when he was hit again, and fell into
Macdougal’s arms, ejaculating a few words, which were the
last he spoke. He expired just as he was conveyed to
General Gibbs’ house, thus falling a sacrifice to the misconduct
of his troops, by which Great Britain lost one of
her ablest and bravest soldiers, and myself one I must ever
regret both as a commander and a friend.”</p>

<p>The troops advanced until very near the enemy’s line;
but, the enemy’s fire becoming extremely heavy, they stopped,
and began firing; and, confusion taking place, nothing could
induce them to advance farther; so that, after losing a great
number of officers and men, they fell back. A party, consisting
of the light companies of the 7th, 43rd, and 93rd
Regiments, with one hundred negroes, under the command of
Lieut.-Colonel Rennie, 21st Regiment,&mdash;taking with them a
spiking party of Artillery, under Lieutenant Ford,&mdash;attacked
the advanced work on the right of the enemy’s line, which
they succeeded in carrying, but not without great loss,
Colonel Rennie and many officers and men being killed.
They kept possession of the outwork for some time, and at
last were obliged to leave it, in consequence of the heavy fire
from the main work. This force was the advanced part of
General Keane’s column, which consisted of the 93rd Regiment,
with two companies of the 95th. It had been arranged
that, in the event of Colonel Thornton succeeding in capturing
the works on the other side of the river, General
Keane’s column should press after Colonel Rennie’s force,
and endeavour to turn the right of the enemy’s line through
the small outwork. Unfortunately, the delay in sending
Colonel Thornton’s force across caused Sir Edward Pakenham
to alter this plan; and General Keane’s column was ordered
to join the left of the 2nd Brigade in the main attack. What
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
was the result? General Keane complied with the new
order, and attacked the line to the left of the 2nd Brigade;
but the ditch was found to be too deep at this place, and,
after the most gallant exertions, his attack was repulsed
with heavy loss. Had Colonel Rennie’s force, on taking the
outwork, been followed by the 93rd Regiment, it is extremely
probable that, by means of the open communication between
it and the main work, the latter might have been entered
and carried.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Colonel Thornton’s force, which had
crossed the river without opposition, advanced rapidly, and
carried everything before them. They turned and captured
with great gallantry the whole of the enemy’s entrenchments,
becoming possessors of the flanking batteries, which
it had been decided, if possible, to secure and silence before
the main attack commenced. These batteries contained sixteen
<span class="sidenote">Major
Michell to
Colonel
Dickson,
8 Jan.
1815.</span>
guns and howitzers; and on one of the latter was found
the inscription, “Taken at the surrender of York Town in
1781.” Major Michell’s conduct during this attack was
thus described in Colonel Thornton’s despatch: “Major
Michell of the Royal Artillery afforded me much assistance
by his able direction of the firing of some rockets,
it not having been found practicable in the first instance
to bring over the artillery attached to his command.”
Had the attack on the left bank of the Mississippi been
as well carried out as that on the right, the defeat of the
Americans would have been certain. As it was, General
Lambert, to whom the command fell on the death of Sir
Edward Pakenham, seeing how desperate the state of affairs
was, and bearing in mind that no fewer than 2000 men
had been killed or wounded, decided on withdrawing the
army to its old encampment, which was to be strengthened
to prevent surprise&mdash;should the enemy adopt the offensive.
He also recalled Colonel Thornton’s force from the other bank,
but not until that gallant officer had demolished the captured
batteries and spiked their guns. He then decided on
abandoning the expedition;&mdash;levelling the batteries which
had been thrown up;&mdash;and rendering the heavy ordnance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
unserviceable. The boats were removed from the river and
placed in the canal, and the wounded were sent away as
rapidly as the limited boat accommodation would permit.
In answer to some proposals made by General Lambert, the
Americans agreed that all prisoners should be returned on
both sides; and promised that the wounded in their possession
should be sent down the river to the English ships.</p>

<p>The retreat of the English army towards the landing-place,
where they were to re-embark, was admirably conducted
in the face of great difficulties. The design was so
effectually concealed from the enemy, that by the 18th
January the whole army, with its field artillery and stores,
had moved, and the bridges in its rear had been destroyed,
without attracting the enemy’s notice. It may interest
the reader to know that the rocket detachments acted as the
Artillery of the rear-guard. On the evening of the 28th
January the whole of the army had embarked on board the
fleet. In the despatch from General Lambert reporting the
<span class="sidenote">‘London
Gazette,’
8 March,
1815.</span>
re-embarkation of the army, he wrote: “Lieut.-Colonel
Dickson, Royal Artillery, has displayed his usual abilities
and assiduity: he reports to me his general satisfaction
with all the officers under his command, especially Major
Munro, senior officer of the Royal Artillery previous to
his arrival, and the officers commanding companies.”</p>

<p>Before the news of the Peace, which had been concluded
between England and America, reached the army which had
been discomfited at New Orleans, a successful affair for the
English arms took place. General Lambert had now proceeded
with his force against Fort Bowyer, Mobile, and,
after deliberate approaches by the Engineers, and the erection
of powerful batteries, the fort was summoned. After
a short parley, its Governor surrendered: begging, however,
to be permitted to defer its evacuation until the following
day, <i>as so many of his men had got drunk</i>. This was
agreed to: but the gate of the fort was immediately given
over to a company of British Infantry, and the British flag
was hoisted. On the 12th February, the garrison marched
out; and on the 13th, the arrival of the news of the Peace,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
which had been signed at Ghent, put an end to further
operations.</p>

<p>The Second American War was unjustifiable in its commencement&mdash;was
unpopular with the majority of the
Northern States&mdash;and failed to effect either of the two great
objects desired by the Americans&mdash;the annexation of Canada,
or the coercion of embarrassed England into their own
terms. Sixty years have passed away; and the first of these
dreams is as visionary as it ever was. The loyalty of Canada
is undimmed; and her power for self-defence is marvellously
increased. She remains a Naboth’s vineyard in the
eyes of American Ahabs: but their power for gratifying
their lust is diminishing yearly with the development of
Canadian resources, and the political manhood of the Canadian
people. What is to be said of the second of the two
objects which inspired the men who declared the war of
1812? For nearly three years&mdash;while they were fighting
obscure and petty battles in the north and west, in which
the combatants were numbered by hundreds only&mdash;the
country, which they had attacked so wantonly while bearing
her Titanic burden of war, was writing on the pages of
history tales of conquest in Europe, which shall never die.
Not until her hands were free again did England suffer the
disaster at New Orleans: as if the fates grudged her unfilial
sons their wish to strike with disaster the parent country,
while in the agony of another struggle. And ere they
obtained this one solace from New Orleans, the hand of the
invader had reached the American capital.</p>

<p>But what better description of the uselessness of this war
can be given than the words used by a modern historian in
describing the Peace agreed to between the two countries?
<span class="sidenote">Russell’s
‘History
of Modern
Europe.’</span>
“<i>No notice whatever</i>,” he writes, “was taken of the circumstances
which occasioned the war.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<span class="medium smcap">Waterloo.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> year, with which this narrative must for the present be
brought to an end, was an eventful one. The same year
which witnessed the great battle of Waterloo was the hundredth
of the Regiment’s existence. How marvellous was the
development of England’s Artillery between 1716 and 1815,
cannot be better seen than in contrasting the two struggling
companies of the former year with the magnificent force of
Artillery collected in Belgium in 1815, of which its commander,
<span class="sidenote">To D. A. G.
dated
Brussels,
16 May,
1815.</span>
Sir George Wood, wrote: “I do believe there never
was in the world such a proportion of Artillery so well
equipped. The result must be felt by Europe.”</p>

<p>The growing importance of the arm is apparent from the
following statistics. The proportion of guns per 1000 men
in the British armies at Marlborough’s three famous battles
was as follows: Blenheim, 1·2; Ramilies, 2; and Malplaquet,
1·1. In the Peninsula, the proportion was somewhat
higher: at Corunna, 3; Talavera, 1·2; Albuera, 1·2; Salamanca,
2; Vittoria, 1·3; Nivelle, 1·3; Orthes, 1·3; and
Toulouse, 1·2. But during the whole of the Peninsular War,
the Duke of Wellington complained that he was inadequately
supplied with Artillery; and as soon as war was inevitable
in 1815, he urged upon the Government at home to send him
a large proportion of that arm. The result was that in the
British army at the battle of Waterloo the proportion of
guns per 1000 men was no less than 3·7.</p>

<p>The circumstances, which led to this great battle, must
first be briefly stated. It will be in the reader’s recollection
that in February 1815, Napoleon quitted Elba; and on the
20th March entered the Tuileries. As he had foreseen, the
army rallied round him; but to his mortification he found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
coldness and even mistrust on the part of the Chambers, and
a decided apathy on the part of the civil population. He
beheld also the whole of continental Europe resolving to
arm against him,&mdash;to stamp out the man, who had so
audaciously violated the solemn Convention of Paris; while
England&mdash;to compensate for the weakness of her military
contingent&mdash;furnished money to the other Powers, and a
General whose name was in itself a host. No uncertain
sound came from the European council, which sat at Vienna;
and Napoleon saw before him a stern and growing resolution
for war to the bitter end. He was not sorry. If he could
win battles, he knew that he would have found a cure for all
coldness at home:&mdash;the army, which had again placed him
on the throne, would, if victorious, consolidate his power, and
make him independent of all who distrusted him. He commenced,
therefore, to reorganize and equip a force which
should sweep all before it. He hastened his preparations,
in the hope of encountering his enemies in detail, before
they should have effected that concentration of their armies
along the entire eastern frontier of France, which he knew
they contemplated. It will be seen, hereafter, that on more
than one occasion during this last of Napoleon’s campaigns,
he was guilty of unaccountable lack of energy; but no one
can fail to admire the spirit and ability with which in the
short spring of that fatal year he organized the army, which
was to ensure his complete success, or witness his utter
ruin.</p>

<p>To realise his difficulties, one must bear in mind the state
<span class="sidenote">Hooper.</span>
of the country which he governed. “France had exhausted
her vigour in the unrestrained indulgence of her passion
for military glory. Her blood was impoverished,&mdash;her
muscles relaxed, her nerves unstrung, her moral force
debilitated by twenty-three years of almost uninterrupted
warfare. The laurels gathered in a hundred battles were
poor compensation for a paralyzed industry and a crippled
commerce,&mdash;for desolate corn-fields and half-cultured vineyards.
She was ’la belle France’ no longer;&mdash;she had
used her prime in the debauch of war!” And yet from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
this country, Napoleon, before the middle of June, had
raised the effective force of the regular army to no less than
276,000 men; besides having 200,000 other and inferior
troops.</p>

<p>He determined to carry the war first into Belgium. For
concentrating an army with this view, the line of fortresses
on the French frontier to the north-east offered special
advantages. And, on crossing it in force, he hoped to defeat
the Prussians and English separately,&mdash;to make by this
means the war and the Government unpopular in England,&mdash;and
to detach from the Allies some whom he believed to be
but half-hearted in their opposition to him. Another and
important reason for selecting Belgium as the theatre of his
operations, was the undoubted presence in that country of
many who on his first success would flock to his standard.</p>

<p>On the night of the 14th June, Napoleon had collected on
the French side of the frontier an army ready to march on
the following morning, consisting of 128,000 men, and 344
guns. Of this number, 22,000 were cavalry; and the whole
force was divided into five corps d’armée, besides the Imperial
Guard, and four corps of reserve cavalry. On that
night he slept at Avesnes, which he made his head-quarters,
and from which he issued a characteristic address to his
troops. Leaving him there,&mdash;with the great mass of his
<span class="sidenote">Hooper.</span>
army “gathered, so to speak, to a head at Beaumont,” and
pointing directly upon Charleroi,&mdash;the reader is invited to
turn to the English army, and examine its constitution and
disposition.</p>

<p>A force of Artillery had been in Holland for some time
with Sir T. Graham,&mdash;under the command of Sir G. A. Wood;
and this formed the nucleus of the contingent of that arm in
the Duke of Wellington’s army in Belgium. Many names
familiar to the reader re-appear in the lists of those who
fought at Waterloo. Colonel&mdash;now Sir Alexander&mdash;Dickson
was still in America; but arrived in time for the battle.
Others, who had received honours for their Peninsular
services, were also there: Sir Augustus Frazer, Sir John
May, Sir Hew Ross, and Sir Robert Gardiner. Norman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
Ramsay, transferred to another troop in order to be present,
had also joined; and was already, as Sir Augustus Frazer
<span class="sidenote">Frazer’s
Letters,
p. 532.</span>
wrote, “adored by his men:&mdash;kind, generous, and manly, he
is more than the friend of his soldiers.” Other names will
appear, as the narrative proceeds; suffice it at present to
say that it is doubtful if ever in one field, or even in one
generation, the Regiment has had so many able men
gathered together.</p>

<p>Sir George Wood was enthusiastic, and revelled in his
command. His enthusiasm, while not forbidding him to
point out his wants, aided him in remedying or bearing
them. They were at first but two in number; but they
were rather important to a force, for they were officers and
men. Fortunately for him and the Corps, General Macleod
was still Deputy Adjutant-General of the Royal Artillery,
and was indefatigable in supplying Sir George Wood’s
demands. As fast as the companies and drivers arrived
from America, they were sent to Belgium; but the demand
still exceeded the supply. Only six days before the battle,
it is recorded that no fewer than 1000 drivers were wanting.
This had been partly caused by the Duke of Wellington
insisting on the formation of three brigades of 18-pounders,
to be placed under the command of Sir Alexander Dickson;
and partly by the demands of the small-arm ammunition
trains. He would neither hire nor enlist Belgian drivers,
saying that he placed too much consequence on his Artillery
to trust it to such a crew; and he ordered Sir George Wood
to write to General Macleod, requesting that four companies
of foot Artillery might be sent out to act as drivers. It was
not often that the Duke tried to coax the Board, or honoured
<span class="sidenote">Sir G.
Wood
to D. A. G.
Brussels,
9 June,
1815.</span>
it with his reasons; but on this occasion he did. He said
that he was well aware that it was not the particular duty
of Artillery soldiers to take care of horses, but he was
confident that should the Master-General be pleased to
allow that duty to be performed by gunners for the present,
the service would receive much greater benefit,&mdash;“the
Artillery officers having more power over their own men,
than any given number from the Line;” and that in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
case of a siege they might do their Artillery duties in the
trenches, as at Antwerp in 1814.</p>

<p>It was on the 4th April, 1815, that the Duke of Wellington
reached Brussels. Less fortunate than Sir George Wood, he
found that his demands, at first, were merely made excuses
by the authorities at home for the exercise of official patronage.
He at last ironically suggested to them that it would
be well, before sending him any more Generals, to send
him some men for them to command. The local arrangements,
as far as the Artillery was concerned, are graphically
described in Sir A. Frazer’s letters, and in General Mercer’s
journal of the Waterloo campaign. The historian must,
however, draw his information from a less sparkling stream,&mdash;the
official letters of Sir George Wood and others. From
these it is ascertained that Ostend was the principal port of
disembarkation for artillery and stores: that Sir George
Wood himself, and afterwards Sir A. Frazer and Lieutenant-Colonel
S. G. Adye, superintended the arrival of these at
Ostend, and their removal to various places; and that in
these matters they were assisted by a man whom all united
to pronounce marvellously able, Mr. Commissary Stace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir G.
Wood
to D. A. G.
Ostend,

1815.</div>

<p>It appears that the urgent demands for more Horse
Artillery came from Sir A. Frazer, who was appointed to the
command of that branch; whereas the Duke himself at first
seemed more anxious to get drivers for the brigades, and
foot Artillerymen for the garrisons of Mons, Oudenarde,
Ghent, and Ath. As early as the beginning of May, the
Duke almost broke Captain Whinyates’s heart by deciding
on changing his rocket troop into an ordinary troop: nor
was it without much difficulty and pleading, that Sir G.
Wood succeeded in obtaining permission for him to carry
<span class="sidenote">Mercer’s
Journal,
vol. i.
p. 166.</span>
a proportion of 12-pounder rockets with his guns. The
Duke’s prejudice against rockets was unmistakable; and
his unofficial language on this occasion was somewhat unfeeling;
but the official reason he gave was that when he
<span class="sidenote">Sir G. A.
Wood
to D. A. G.
1 May,
1815.</span>
had a proper proportion of Artillery attached to his army, as
all other nations had, then he would bring the Rocket
Corps into play; but that he thought, situated as he was, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
gun a superior weapon. The argument, which had most
weight in support of the request to retain a proportion of
<span class="sidenote">To D.-A.-G.
8 May,
1815.</span>
rockets, was thus stated by Sir G. Wood: “The Duke was
determined at first to place the rockets in depôt, but after
the good appearance of our friend Whinyates’s troop, and
the plan and mode he suggested to his Grace, he has
permitted him to take into the field eight hundred rounds
of rockets with his six guns, which makes him very
complete.”</p>

<p>The horsing of the Horse and Field Batteries during the
Waterloo campaign was admirable; but the Field Artillery
excelled in this particular to such an extent, that Sir George
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.</span>
Wood wrote: “the Horse Artillery are really jealous of
their appearance.” The Duke had inspected the 9-pounder
Field Brigade, commanded by Captain C. F. Sandham, and
had been so pleased that he desired General Maitland to
write to that officer as follows: “The Duke of Wellington
has desired me to communicate to you (and I have to
request you will do so to the officers, non-commissioned
officers, and soldiers under your command), his <i>unqualified
approbation</i> of the appearance of the brigade. I feel
gratified in being able to assure you that he commented
on the horses, appointments, and every part of it, with
peculiar approbation.” This company, which was No. 9
of the 3rd Battalion, and fired the first shot at Waterloo,
was&mdash;alas!&mdash;reduced in 1819. In forwarding a copy of the
above complimentary letter to the Ordnance, Sir G. Wood
said: “All the other brigades are equal, if not better, in
horses.” What a contrast to the Field Brigades of Egypt,
and the first years of the Peninsula!&mdash;how staunchly had the
lessons taught by the experience of the latter been studied
and accepted!</p>

<p>On the 12th May, the Duke desired Sir G. Wood to
write to the Ordnance, requesting that two troops of Horse
Artillery, in addition to the six already in Belgium, should
be sent out; stating, as his reason, the deficiency of Field
Brigades, and the impossibility of getting drivers in sufficient
numbers. He would gladly have taken 1000 drivers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
over his actual artillery wants, for service with the small-arm
ammunition waggons, which he had succeeded in horsing
in the country. Sir H. Ross’s, the Chestnut Troop, and
<span class="sidenote">Frazer’s

Major Beane’s, were accordingly despatched; and arrived,
the former, at Ghent, on the 9th June, and the latter on the
10th, at Ostend.</p>

<p>Constant changes in the armament of the troops of Horse
Artillery in Belgium had been suggested with a view to
increasing the weight of metal, and some of a tentative
description were made in the beginning of May. On the
16th of that month, the following armament was finally
decided upon<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;Major Beane’s Troop, when it arrived, was armed like Sir H. Ross’s.</p></blockquote>

<p>This change of armament proved very beneficial at
Waterloo; but the credit of introducing it seems to have
been ascribed, without reason, to the Duke of Wellington.
<span class="sidenote">Frazer’s
Letters,
p. 551.</span>
Writing two days after the battle, Sir A. Frazer said: “I
must be allowed to express my satisfaction, that, <i>contrary
to the opinion of most, I ventured to change (and under discouraging
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>-
circumstances of partial want of means) the
ordnance of the Horse Artillery</i>.” And again: “I bless my
stars that I had obstinacy enough to persist in changing
the guns of the Horse Artillery.” The forethought was
certainly more consistent in one who was an able and enthusiastic
Horse-Artilleryman, than in one who, like the Duke
of Wellington, knew little of Artillery details or tactics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mercer’s
Diary,
vol. i.
p. 160.</div>

<p>The arrangement and constitution of a troop of Horse
Artillery at Waterloo are given with minuteness by General
Mercer in his Diary. Taking the troop, which he commanded,
although only its 2nd Captain,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> as a sample of those more
heavily armed, it appears that each gun, and the howitzer,
were drawn by 8 horses, and each waggon by 6. Each of
the six mounted detachments required 8 horses; 5 were
required for the staff-sergeants and farriers; 18 for the
spare-wheel carriage, forge, curricle-cart, baggage-waggon,
&amp;c.; 17 horses for officers, and 6 mules, and 30 spare, additional
horses. This gave a total of 226 per troop. There
were 23 non-commissioned officers, artificers, and trumpeters;
80 gunners, and 84 drivers. On parade, the 5½-inch
howitzer was the right of the centre division of the troop.
It was of this troop that Blücher said, at the review near
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
p. 217.</span>
Grammont on the 29th May, that “he had never seen anything
so superb in his life;” concluding by exclaiming,
“Mein Gott! dere is not von orse in dies batterie wich is
not goot for Veldt-Marshal!”</p>

<p>There is in the official correspondence of May and June
1815, a collection of quaintly amusing letters from various
2nd Captains of Artillery in Belgium, who, prior to the war,
had been left in undisturbed command of their batteries,&mdash;their
1st Captains being specially employed&mdash;and who
now wrote begging that the latter should not be allowed to
join, and thus rob them of their chances of distinction and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
preferment. One of these&mdash;Captain Napier&mdash;wrote direct
to the Master-General, protesting against the appointment
of Captain Bolton to command his battery; which, he wrote,
“hurt him much.” Little did he think as he wrote that a
mightier hand than the Master-General’s was in a very few
days to cancel the appointment, and that ere the first battle
should be over, he should resume the command, vacant by
his senior’s death! Pages might be filled with instances of
this resentment at the presence of a 1st Captain; nor were
they confined to attempts to prevent the seniors from
joining. One 2nd Captain, whose commanding officer was
wounded at Quatre Bras, wrote off immediately, begging the
Master-General to appoint no one in his place, but to leave
the command in his hands.</p>

<p>When the Allies were ready, as far as equipment was concerned,
Brussels remained the head-quarters of the Duke of
Wellington, and the army was scattered through the country,
in a way which has excited much criticism among continental
writers. Napoleon, when he fought the battles of Ligny and
Quatre Bras, had hoped to find the English army still in its
cantonments; but he was disappointed, for it had quitted
them, and commenced to concentrate on the 13th and 14th
June. His intention had been to defeat the Prussians, and
compel them to retire on the base of their communications
and supplies, and to compel the advanced part of the Anglo-allied
army to retire from Quatre Bras on Brussels. In
neither particular were his hopes fulfilled. He certainly
compelled the Prussians, after their defeat at Ligny on the
16th June, to retire; but they quitted the main road to
Namur, along which Napoleon expected that they would continue
their retreat, and marched to Wavre by a road parallel
to that occupied by Wellington between Quatre Bras and
Brussels. This brilliant movement was unsuspected by
Napoleon, whose remissness after Ligny and during the early
part of the 17th was unaccountable. Disappointed in his
<span class="sidenote">Sir G.
Wood
to D.-A.-G.
24/6/15.</span>
plans with regard to the Prussians, he failed also in his
purpose against the English. Marshal Ney with two corps
attacked part of the Allied force at Quatre Bras, a place in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
front of the village of Genappe, where two main roads&mdash;from
Genappe to Charleroi, and Namur to Nivelle&mdash;cross one
another. The endurance of the Allies was tried to the
utmost by having to wait the arrival of reinforcements, and
to fight against superior numbers, but it was rewarded by a
<span class="sidenote">Cust.</span>
complete, although costly, victory. The first attack was
received by the Belgians; but Picton’s English division, over
7000 strong, soon came up, followed by over 6,500 Brunswickers
and Germans. The battle commenced at 2 <small>P.M.</small> on
the 16th; and at 4 o’clock the Duke of Wellington came on
the field with a brigade of foreign cavalry, and assumed the
command. Later in the evening, the 1st British division,
under Generals Cook and Maitland, with its artillery, arrived
from Enghien, having marched for a period of fifteen hours;<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
and with the approaching darkness came the retreat of the
French on Frasnes. This defeat ruined the French Emperor’s
plans, and paved the way for the greater defeat of the 18th.</p>

<p>Major Lloyd’s and Major Rogers’ batteries were warmly
engaged at Quatre Bras. Two guns belonging to the former
were lost, but were afterwards recovered. The troop of
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
p. 540.</span>
German Horse Artillery was of great service, sustaining
the reputation which that corps had earned in the Peninsula.
But the losses among the Artillerymen were small in proportion
to those among the regiments of Infantry. Of 3750
British killed and wounded at Quatre Bras, only 28 belonged
to the Royal Artillery. The losses were, however, very
severe among the horses, and crippled the batteries very
much. In Sir George Wood’s despatch announcing the
<span class="sidenote">To D.-A.-G.
24 June,
1815.</span>
battle, he wrote: “I beg you will be pleased to mention to
his Lordship, the Master-General, the good conduct
of that part of the Artillery which was engaged on
the 16th. They were warmly engaged, being several
times charged by the French Cavalry,&mdash;and tended much
to the success of the day.” The merits of Quatre Bras,
as a scene on which English courage and endurance were
nobly displayed, are too often forgotten in the recollections
of the greater battle, by which it was so speedily
followed.</p>

<p>In consequence of the Prussians moving on Wavre, it
became necessary for the Duke of Wellington to fall back
also; and orders were given on the 17th for the army to
retire to Mont St. Jean, not far from the village of Waterloo.
This position had been carefully selected and examined by
the Duke, with a view to the event which was now at hand.
The retreat through Genappe was effected with the greatest
order, and was covered by the Horse Artillery and Cavalry.
<span class="sidenote">Mercer’s
Diary,
vol. i.
p. 270.</span>
Captain Mercer’s and Captain Whinyates’s troops were the
last to retire, the former officer having been detailed for that
duty&mdash;the latter having exceeded his orders, and remained
behind, hoping to come in for some fighting. For the Horse
Artillery and Cavalry, the retreat was no bed of roses. The
heavy rains had made the roads and fields almost impassable.
Genappe is in a hollow; and as the Horse Artillery mounted
the slopes towards La Belle Alliance, pursued by the French
Cavalry, they had to move at a gallop through fields, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
would have tried them even at a walk. Sir Robert Gardiner’s
troop was especially taxed in this way; and he used
frequently to say that it was fortunate that his 6-pounder
armament had not been exchanged for the heavier nature;
for his guns would certainly have been captured had this
been done. The nature of the ground which was traversed
may be gathered from the fact that not a horse in Sir
Robert’s troop reached Mont St. Jean without losing at least
<span class="sidenote">Communicated
by Colonel
L. Gardiner,
R.-H.-A.</span>
one shoe. The whole night of the 17th was spent in shoeing
the horses, and getting the troop ready for the work of the
following day.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th June, the French army was
drawn up on the south side, and the Allies on the Brussels
side, of a long hollow, which common <i>parlance</i> has inaccurately
named the “field of Waterloo.” The strength of the
French army, according to the industrious Siborne&mdash;checked
by later writers&mdash;was, in round numbers, 72,000; that of
the Allies, about 68,000. The French had, in addition,
Marshal Grouchy’s force of 33,000 men, fourteen miles away,
on a blind chase after the Prussians, who were already six
miles nearer Waterloo than their pursuers; and Wellington
had a division of 18,000 men on detachment to his right,
towards Hal, at a distance of ten miles. This extra precaution&mdash;this
strange nervousness about his right&mdash;has been
much and justly condemned by critics. When one reflects
of what value that force would have been at different times
during the 18th, one cannot but feel that if the Allied information
to the right had been as carefully procured, as it had
been to the left of the army, the whole of these 18,000 men
might have been drawn in to the main body. However,
even admitting this to be a blunder, the French were nevertheless
utterly outmanœuvred. Napoleon’s remissness on
the night of the 16th, and his idleness on the morning of
the 17th, were now to receive the punishment which such
qualities in the face of an enemy always deserve, and
generally get.

expresses it&mdash;a drama in five acts. The first was the attack
on Hougomont at 11.30 <small>A.M.</small>, many precious hours having
been wasted by Napoleon; the second was the attack by the
French on La Haye Sainte, at half-past 1; the third was
the celebrated succession of cavalry attacks on the Allied
line between Hougomont and La Haye Sainte, commencing
at 4 o’clock; the fourth was the successful attack by Marshal
Ney on La Haye Sainte, at 6 o’clock,&mdash;an event which if
properly used by Napoleon might have had a very grave
effect on the result of the battle, for it caused a great gap
in the very centre of the Allied line; and the fifth was the
celebrated attack on the Allied centre made by 12 battalions
of the Imperial Guard, strengthened by the co-operation of
<span class="sidenote">Kennedy.</span>
other divisions, and supported “by a powerful Artillery, and
what remained of the Cavalry.”</p>

<p>In the attack on Hougomont, the battery which most distinguished
itself was the famous old I Troop&mdash;now D Battery,
B Brigade, R.H.A.&mdash;under Major R. Bull, whose Peninsular
history rivals that of the Chestnut Troop. It was armed
with howitzers; and cleared the wood in front of Hougomont
of the French troops,&mdash;firing shell with wonderful accuracy
over the heads of the English Infantry; an operation
<span class="sidenote">Frazer’s
Letters,
p. 556.</span>
so delicate, as to make the Duke remark to Sir Augustus
Frazer, who ordered it, that he hoped he was not undertaking
too much. But Sir Augustus said that he could depend on
the troop; and the event proved that he was right: for after
ten minutes’ firing, the French were driven out of the wood.
Webber Smith’s troop was also hotly engaged during this
first attack, and suffered during the day very severely, not
merely&mdash;as all did&mdash;from the French skirmishers, but also
from having been on one occasion enfiladed by one of Prince
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
Jerome’s batteries. Captain Bolton’s field brigade, which
was to have so great glory at a critical period in the day,
was in action at the first attack on Hougomont; and when
subsequently moved more to the centre of the Allied line, its
place to the left of Hougomont was taken by Norman
Ramsay’s troop. It has already been mentioned that the
first shot fired by the Allied Artillery at Waterloo was fired
by Captain Sandham’s brigade. This was in reply to the
first attack on Hougomont; and during the day no fewer
than 1100 rounds of ammunition were fired by this single
brigade.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> Although beyond the province of this work to
enter into the Infantry details of the battle, it must yet be
said that, even in a day when the British Infantry showed
a valour and endurance which have never been surpassed,
their defence of Hougomont shines with especial lustre.
Knowing its value, as strengthening the right of his line,
the Duke had taken precautions on the previous night by
loopholing the walls to render its defence more practicable.
Although set on fire, and attacked repeatedly by superior
numbers, it was never lost; its defenders showing a tenacity
and courage, unexampled almost in the annals of war.</p>

<p>In the second act of the drama&mdash;the first attack on La
Haye Sainte&mdash;Captain Whinyates’s troop and Major Rogers’
field brigade were first engaged; and it is important to
<span class="sidenote"><i>Vide</i>
Appendix
A.</span>
remember, with a view to the argument, which is to come,
that it was during this act that the Artillery of the reserve
was brought up. Sir Hew Ross’s and Major Beane’s troops
suffered at this time great loss. Among the officers alone,
Major Beane was killed, and both 2nd captains and two
subalterns wounded.</p>

<p>The third act, the charges of the French cavalry, will be
fully discussed in the argument, which will be found in the
Appendix. Suffice it to say, at present, that they were
preceded by clouds of skirmishers, and by a tremendous
artillery fire; and that at no period of the day were the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
losses among the Artillery more severe. Among those who
fell then was Norman Ramsay; and it was the lot of his
<span class="sidenote">Frazer’s
Letters,
p. 548.</span>
dearest friend to witness and to tell the circumstances. “In
a momentary lull of the fire,” wrote Sir Augustus Frazer,
“I buried my friend Ramsay, from whose body I took the
portrait of his wife, which he always carried next his
heart. Not a man assisted at the funeral who did not
shed tears. Hardly had I cut from his head the hair
which I enclose, and laid his yet warm body in the grave,
when our convulsive sobs were stifled by the necessity of
<span class="sidenote">Nivelle,
20 June,
1815.</span>
returning to renew the struggle.” Two days later, the
same hand wrote: “Now that the stern feelings of the day
have given way to the return of better ones, I feel with
the bitterness of anguish not to be described, the loss of
my friend Ramsay. Nor for this friend alone, but for
<span class="sidenote">Dated
6 July,
1815.</span>
many others, though less dear than poor Norman.” And
yet again, writing from Paris, Sir A. Frazer said: “I cannot
get Ramsay out of my head; such generosity, such romantic
self-devotion as his, are not common.” It was
written of Ramsay, “Sibi satis vixit,&mdash;non patriæ;” and it is
difficult to conceive a nobler eulogy. A man who never
tampered with temptation, but trampled on it instead,&mdash;he
left behind him the story of a life, which is a model for his
successors in the Corps to imitate. There is a Waterloo
going on daily in a soldier’s life: his enemies are more
skilled than Napoleon&mdash;they are as relentless as death: they
come dressed in many garbs, but their names are sloth,
ignorance, and vice; and the weapon by which alone they
can be overcome is an earnest and conscientious performance
of duty. This weapon must be grasped most firmly,
and wielded most mercilessly, when the duties to be performed
are monotonous or uninviting; but its unfailing use,
even through a life of uninteresting routine, will earn for
the soldier, when the night comes, the same words as were
spoken of Norman Ramsay, “Satis sibi vixit,&mdash;non patriæ.”</p>

<p>The fourth act of the drama witnessed, at 6 o’clock, the
capture of La Haye Sainte by the French, after a magnificent
defence by Major Baring and part of the King’s German
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
Legion, which only failed from want of ammunition. There
seems little doubt that the Duke of Wellington had underrated
the importance of this position; indeed, he is said in
later years to have admitted it. Fortunately, Napoleon did
not sufficiently note the advantage he had gained; and
contented himself with using its now friendly cover in
preparation for his great final effort.</p>

<p>The Prussians had by this time arrived, and were in force
on the French right. At the village of Planchenoit, they
were already in such numbers that the French General,
Loban, required 16,000 men to keep them in check. On the
extreme left of the English, at Papillote, the advanced
parties of another Prussian column had also arrived; and,
all fear for his left being now at an end, the Duke of
Wellington was enabled to strengthen his centre, and his
right centre, by moving Vivian’s and Vaudeleur’s Cavalry
Brigades from the left, accompanied by Sir Robert Gardiner’s
troop of Horse Artillery.</p>

<p>The necessity of a great final effort was now apparent to
Napoleon; and the curtain rose on the fifth act of the drama
at half-past 7 o’clock. It is a point which the Artilleryman
should never forget, that, in this majestic advance of the
Imperial Guard, its head was broken and thrown into
confusion by the fire of Captain Bolton’s guns, before the
52nd Regiment, and the Guards, did their celebrated work.
It was at this time that Captain Bolton was killed, and that
the Duke personally gave his orders to Captain Napier,&mdash;the
2nd Captain,&mdash;as the French approached, to load with
canister.</p>

<p>While the advancing columns of the enemy were in the
hollow, their artillery carried on a cannonade over their
heads, more terrible than had been witnessed during the
day. The following description of Mercer’s battery at the
end of the day will give the reader an idea of the murderous
<span class="sidenote">Mercer’s
Journal,
vol. i.
p. 331.</span>
fire to which the Allies were exposed. “Of 200 fine
horses,” he wrote, “with which we had entered the battle,
upwards of 140 lay dead, dying, or severely wounded. Of
the men, scarcely two-thirds of those necessary for <i>four</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
guns remained; and those so completely exhausted, as to
be totally incapable of further exertion. Lieutenant
Breton had had three horses killed under him; Lieutenant
Hincks was wounded in the breast by a spent ball;
Lieutenant Leathes on the hip by a splinter; and although
untouched myself, my horse had no less than eight wounds.
Our guns and carriages were all together in a confused
heap, intermingled with dead and wounded horses, which
it had not been possible to disengage from them.” And
this was but typical of most of the batteries engaged.</p>

<p>As for the Infantry, words cannot paint too highly their
endurance on that long day. One regiment had 400 men
killed or wounded, before they were allowed to fire a trigger;
and all suffered heavily. Yet there was not a word of
distrust as regarded their great commander. They pined
with all their hearts for permission to attack, instead of
lying where they often were&mdash;being shot by scores; but
discipline was stronger than desire. Even at the worst
times, a word from the Duke, or a report that he was coming,
sufficed to produce a silence and a steadiness, as perfect as if
on parade in a barrack-square. For those who were present,
Waterloo was thus a double victory,&mdash;over their enemies,
and over themselves. True discipline is a succession of such
victories.</p>

<p>With the noble charge of the 52nd, followed by the
general advance of the whole line, the French retreat
became a rout,&mdash;the most disastrous, as has been said, on
record: but the record referred to did not include the
Titanic battles of the last few years. The Prussians took
up the pursuit, and the Allied Army bivouacked on the field
of battle.</p>

<p>So much detail connected with the services of the Artillery
at Waterloo must of necessity be given in the Appendix,
that it has not been thought advisable to anticipate it here.
But there are several interesting Regimental matters connected
with the battle, for the insertion of which this seems
the most suitable place.</p>

<p>There were two field brigades, which formed part of the

<p>These brigades received the boon service granted for the
battle of Waterloo under a Horse Guards’ decision, which
was promulgated in Paris on the 5th September, 1815, including
among Waterloo men all troops, which had on the
18th June been employed either in the village of Waterloo,
or had been detached to the right to prevent the advance of
the enemy towards Brussels by Hal.</p>

<p>The companies which were present with small-arm
ammunition, or which furnished detachments for that
service, will be found in the chapters on the various
battalions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span></p>

<p>The commendations passed on the corps generally for its
services at Waterloo will be found in Appendix A, in support
of the argument therein contained. But it may be interesting
to the friends or descendants of individual officers, who
were present, and who specially distinguished themselves, to
read extracts from the reports sent to the Ordnance. These
<span class="sidenote">Dated
Le Cateau,
24 June,
1815.</span>
will be given without comment. “I feel,” wrote Sir George
Wood, “that I should particularly mention that I wish
Lieutenant-Colonel Sir John May may succeed to one of
the vacant troops; and I do assure you the conduct of
Major Lloyd was conspicuous to the whole army. This
officer and Captain Mercer<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> are candidates for the other
vacant troop. Captain Mercer was the senior second
captain in the field, and behaved nobly. I must also
mention that Lieutenant Louis commanded Major Bull’s
troop for some time. Lieutenant Sandilands was the only
officer left with the command of poor Major Ramsay’s
troop, the rest of the officers being wounded. I beg to
mention him to your protection, as well as Lieutenants
Coles and Wells, whom I have appointed to do duty with
the Horse Artillery, and I beg you will use your interest
with the Master-General that they may be confirmed....
I shall certainly give in the name of Captain Macdonald
for brevet promotion; it was with great difficulty that he
could be made quit the field when severely wounded,&mdash;as
well as Lieutenant Brereton, who remained in the field of
battle until Lieutenant-Colonel Macdonald ordered him to
the rear, to have his wounds dressed.... Although
Lieutenant-Colonel Gold was in command of a Division of
Artillery in the field, I beg you will mention to the
Master-General that I have received great benefit from
his advice and zeal, during the time I have commanded
the Artillery in the Pays-Bas.... I beg leave to mention
that Lieutenant Bloomfield was both days in the field with
me; and should he wish at some future time to be posted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
to the Horse Brigade, I hope he will not be forgot.” In
another despatch to General Macleod, Sir George Wood
wrote as follows: “I must call your particular attention to
the officers who attended me personally in the field, whose
merits I beg to recommend to the consideration of His
Lordship the Master-General.” These officers were
Lieutenant-Colonel Sir A. Frazer, Lieutenant-Colonel
Sir J. Hartmann, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir A. Dickson,
Lieutenant-Colonel Sir J. May, Captain Baynes, Brigade
Major, Lieutenants Coles, Bloomfield, Bell, and Meëlmann&mdash;all
of whom were mentioned by name.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To Sir
G. A. Wood,

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Macdonald thus described the services
of his Adjutant: “In justice to the conduct of Captain Pakenham,
who acted as my Adjutant in the battle of the 18th,
I feel it a duty I owe this most promising officer to state
to you that he made himself equally conspicuous by his
coolness and bravery, and the precision with which he conveyed
my orders to the troops of Horse Artillery I had the
honour to command on that occasion.” Sir Augustus
Frazer spoke in equally favourable terms of his Adjutant:
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
23 June,
1815.</span>
“I beg to submit my hope that, in the promotion which
may be expected, the Horse Artillery may not lose the
services of Lieutenant Bell, who, both here and in the
Peninsula, has acted as Adjutant of Horse Artillery, and
is an officer of much professional merit, whose judgment,
intelligence, and unceasing application to the duties of his
office, have rendered him very valuable.”</p>

<p>Major Bull thus described the conduct of his gallant
troop, now D Battery, B Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery:
<span class="sidenote">Major
Bull to Sir
A. Frazer,
19 June,
1873.</span>
“I consider it a duty I owe equally to the officers, non-commissioned
officers, gunners, and drivers, to say that,
throughout the day, and in every situation, nothing could
exceed their coolness, intrepidity, and strict attention to
orders; and as a proof of their zeal in the service, at one
period of the evening when we were short of ammunition,
and H Troop” (Major Ramsay’s) “on our left rather short
of gunners, on an application for assistance, several of my
men volunteered joining their guns, until our ammunition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
came up; and as far as was prudent or necessary, I
granted their request. I must also beg leave to say that,
from Major Cairnes having unfortunately fallen very early
in the action, I received the greatest assistance throughout
the day from Lieutenant Louis’s activity; and it is
but justice to this officer to add, that, when I was under
the necessity of quitting the field for half an hour, in consequence
of my being wounded, he commanded the troop
during my absence in a manner that did himself great
credit, and gave me perfect satisfaction at a very arduous
period of the action.”</p>

<p>General Colquhoun Grant, in writing of Captain Walcott,
<span class="sidenote">To Sir
G. A. Wood,
dated
15 July,
1815.</span>
said: “I beg to recommend this gallant and meritorious
officer to your attention.” He added: “I have great
pleasure in embracing this opportunity to mention my
entire and full approbation of the conduct of Lieut.-Colonel
Webber Smith, and the officers and men of his
troop” (now B Battery, B Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery),
“during the whole of the period they have been attached
to the brigade under my command.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Macdonald,&mdash;an enthusiastic Horse
Artilleryman&mdash;in addition to the letter quoted above, wrote
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
dated
16 July,
1815.</span>
as follows: “In addition to the names of the various officers
belonging to the six troops of Royal Horse Artillery,
attached to the Cavalry, whose lot it was to command
troops on the memorable day of the 18th June, it has
occurred to me to be no less my duty to express to you
my admiration of the cool and determined conduct of
Captain Walcott, who was some time detached from his
troop on that day; and who, in the handsomest manner,
after the whole of his ammunition was expended, volunteered
to take charge of some of the guns of Major
Ramsay’s troop, after it had suffered much by the loss
of officers. It is also highly satisfactory to me to report
to you the equally gallant conduct of Captain Dansey, of
Captain Whinyates’s Rocket Troop, which I also had an
opportunity of witnessing; and who was wounded when
detached with rockets in the <i>chaussée</i>, which crossed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
centre of the position. You are already aware, from your
own observation, how much all the officers of these troops
distinguished themselves on the occasion, and what a noble
example they set to the non-commissioned officers and men
by whom it was so gallantly initiated. Words are indeed
inadequate to express my sense of the conduct of all, where
the reputation, which the Horse Artillery had before obtained,
was so nobly sustained, if not even surpassed; and
which I must plead as my excuse for extending the limits
of this communication beyond my original intention, viz.,
that of drawing your attention to the merits of Captains
Walcott and Dansey.”</p>

<p>In reporting the death of Major Lloyd, from his wounds,
<span class="sidenote">Dated
Paris,
3 Aug.
1815.</span>
Sir George Wood wrote: “I can, without hesitation, affirm
that a braver, or more zealous officer, never entered a field
of battle; and who did his duty on the 16th and 18th to
the satisfaction of every General officer.” A few days
later, in enclosing a letter from Lieutenant Brereton, Sir
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
17 Aug.
1815.</span>
George said: “I have received from every commanding
officer the handsomest testimony of the conduct of Lieutenant
Brereton, both in the Peninsula, and at the battle
of Waterloo; and I have it from General Byng to say that,
on the battle of the 16th (the Horse Artillery not being
engaged on that day), he proffered his service to act as
aide-de-camp, which service he performed to the great
satisfaction of the General.” At a subsequent date, in
forwarding an application from Major Percy Drummond,
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
8 Oct.
1815.</span>
Sir George Wood said: “I have ever found Major Drummond
a most active, zealous, and attentive officer, having been
under my command on several occasions, particularly in the
battle of Waterloo.” In acknowledging a letter from
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
28 Jan.
1816.</span>
Major Rogers, Sir George said: “Your company at all times
did you every justice, and proved it under your command
at the battle of Waterloo, in which your brigade bore a distinguished
feature.” Almost every officer who served in the
Artillery at Waterloo, received from his gallant commander
some official commendation; and, by this means, many Regimental
incidents connected with the battle have been handed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
down. In writing, for example, about an officer who lived to
be a revered General in the Corps, Sir George Wood said:
<span class="sidenote">Dated
Valenciennes,
29 Feb,
1816.</span>
“Lieutenant William Anderson has conducted himself in
every situation as a good and zealous officer. On the 18th
June,&mdash;on many occasions during that day,&mdash;he carried my
orders, and brought off some disabled guns under a severe fire.
Having my horses shot, I was forced to dismount him.”</p>

<p>At the battle of Waterloo, the Artillery expended 10,400
rounds of ammunition. The amount fired by one battery,
Captain Sandham’s, has already been stated; and it may be
mentioned here that Captain Whinyates’s troop fired 309
shot, 236 spherical case, 15 common case, and 52 rockets.</p>

<p>The subsequent operations of the English army during
the year, in which this history comes, for the present, to an
end, will merely be glanced at. The main body of the army
marched at once towards Paris; and the damage suffered by
the Artillery during the battle was so quickly repaired, that
Sir George Wood was able to take every gun with him that
had been on the field, with four 18-pounders in addition;
<span class="sidenote">Sir George
Wood to
D.-A.-Gen.,
dated
3 July,
1815.</span>
making a total of 123 pieces of ordnance, and over 20,000
rounds of ammunition, with which the army marched on
Paris. The collapse of any opposition, and the ultimate
occupation of that city by the Allies, are facts well known to
the reader. There were, however, some Artillery operations
against the French fortresses, in which some brigades of
Artillery, under Sir Alexander Dickson, were engaged.
Maubeuge surrendered on the 12th July, and was taken
possession of on the 14th, after three days’ open trenches, and
firing. Landrecy surrendered on the 21st, and was taken
possession of on the 23rd July, after two day’s open trenches,
<span class="sidenote">Sir A.
Dickson,
to D.-A.-G.,
dated
12 Aug.
1815.</span>
and about two hours’ firing. Marienbourg surrendered on
the 28th, and was taken possession of on the 30th July, after
one day’s open trenches and heavy bombardment. Philippeville
was taken possession of on the 10th August, having
surrendered on the 8th, after one day’s open trenches and
heavy bombardment. Sir Alexander Dickson spoke in the
highest terms of the officers and men under his command;
he attributed to their energy the fact that at every place he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
was able to collect, previous to commencing operations,
sufficient ordnance and ammunition to have reduced it, as he
said, by main force. At Maubeuge, he had 60 guns&mdash;30 of
which were 24-pounders,&mdash;20,000 round shot, and 26,000
shells. At Landrecy he had 60 guns, 24,000 round shot, and
22,000 shells. At Marienbourg, he had 15 mortars, with
3000 shells; and 6 24-pounders arrived, just as the place
surrendered. At Philippeville, he had 66 pieces of ordnance,
with 17,000 round shot, and 23,000 shells. During these
operations, the Artillery was attached to a corps of the
Prussian army, by which the sieges of the fortresses were
conducted. The terms on which the duties were performed
<span class="sidenote">Sir A.
Dickson
to D.-A.-G.,
dated
12 Aug.
1815.</span>were somewhat peculiar. “Our line of duty,” wrote Sir
A. Dickson, “is to move the battering-train, keep it in order,
fix the shells, fill the cartridges, and, in short, do every
individual thing except fighting the guns: which my
instructions neither authorize me to do, nor would it be
pleasant to do, if they did; for we should not get the
credit we ought, when working in competition with the
Prussian Artillery: whereas, as the duty is conducted now,
every fair and just credit is allowed for our exertions, and
the service goes on with the utmost cordiality. Prince
Augustus of Prussia is chief of the Artillery of that
kingdom, and he takes into his own hand very much the
application of the artillery; which is very pleasant for me,
as I receive all the arrangements and instructions, direct
from his Royal Highness. An application is given in every
morning at the park during a siege, expressing the
ordnance and ammunition required for the next day; and
in the evening the Prussian Artillery come to receive their
demands. I have, however, a few officers and men of the
Royal Artillery in the trenches, to afford any assistance
when required; and also to watch the practice, report
about the fuzes, &amp;c.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ibid.
dated
22 Aug.
1815.</div>

<p>After the fall of Philippeville, Major Carmichael’s company,
with the advanced division of the battering-train, consisting
of thirty-three mortars and howitzers, reached a point near
Rocroy, on the 15th August:&mdash;followed by Major Michell’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
and Major Wall’s companies with ten 24-pounders, and a
large supply of ammunition. The Prussians opened the
trenches on the night of the 15th, and batteries were prepared
for twenty-one mortars and howitzers. With such
effect were these opened on the morning of the 16th, that
before 9 <small>A.M.</small> Rocroy capitulated. After this event, Prince
Augustus expressed himself highly satisfied with the exertions
of the British Artillery attached to the battering-train; and
orders reached Sir Alexander Dickson from the Duke of
Wellington to bring the second battering-train, which was at
Antwerp, to Brussels, and to land it forthwith. The next
operation of any importance was against the town of Givet,
against which no fewer than one hundred guns were collected.
Before the bombardment commenced, however, the Governor
consented to give up the place, and retire into Charlemont;
which he did on the 11th September.</p>

<p>A force under Sir Charles Colville had been sent against
Cambray, immediately after Waterloo, and the place&mdash;after a
short siege&mdash;was carried on the 25th June. Of the conduct
<span class="sidenote">To the
Duke of
Wellington,
26 June,
1815.</span>
of the Artillery on this occasion, Sir Charles wrote: “The
three brigades of Artillery under Lieutenant-Colonel
Webber Smith, and Majors Unett and Brome, under the
direction of Lieutenant-Colonel Hawker, made particularly
<span class="sidenote">Sir George
Wood to
D.-A.-G.,
Paris,
4 Sept.
1815.</span>
good practice.” The services of Major Unett’s brigade
(now 3 Battery, 7th Brigade) received special mention in a
report from Sir Charles Colville to Sir George Wood; and
the following extract from a letter written by its gallant
commander may interest the officers and men now serving in
<span class="sidenote">Major
Unett
to Sir G.
Wood,
dated
3 Aug.
1815.</span>
the battery. “My brigade, being in reserve, had not an
opportunity of witnessing the late glorious battle of
Waterloo, but it afterwards proceeded with the 4th Division
of the army for the purpose of reducing the fortress of
Cambray; and, in justice to my officers, I must be permitted
to say that my three subalterns, never having been
under fire before, deserve much praise for their cool and
steady behaviour at their guns (within four hundred yards
of the curtain of the citadel, in an open field), and which
was clearly evinced by the uncommon good practice made,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
which so completely silenced the enemy as to cause (by
driving them from their guns and ramparts) a most
trifling loss to our Infantry when they stormed the place.”
The French king entered Cambray on the day after it was
taken: and on the same day, Peronne was taken by General
Maitland and the Guards.</p>

<p>Arrangements for concluding hostilities, and entering
upon a treaty, were soon made in Paris. One of the
conditions inflicted on the French people was that an army
of occupation should be left in France for five&mdash;afterwards
reduced to three&mdash;years; and considerable difficulty was
found in apportioning the various arms in the English contingent
of that army.</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington decided on reducing the Artillery
share to a point far below what Sir George Wood thought
desirable; and the latter urged his views very strongly, but,
as he said, “What can a Lieut.-Colonel do against a Field-Marshal?”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
However, his importunity succeeded in obtaining
an addition of two companies to the Artillery force which
was at first intended to remain in France.</p>

<p>Orders for the shipment of the battering-train also arrived
in the end of 1815, with a view to its return to England;
and, as Sir Alexander Dickson’s active duties on the continent
then ceased, it seems but justice to the memory of
one whose name has occupied so prominent a place in these
pages, to quote a passage from a letter written by Sir George
Wood, proving that his exceptional Peninsular honours had
<span class="sidenote">To
D.-A.-G.,
R.A., dated
Cambray,
2 April,
1816.</span>
not unfitted him for serving, when required, in a subordinate
position:&mdash;“You may expect Sir A. Dickson in the course of
the next week at Woolwich. I have found him the same
good officer and man, as you well know him.”</p>

<p>The reductions, which followed the battle of Waterloo
have been frequently alluded to in these volumes. They
would furnish but a gloomy topic for the historian, for the
pruning-knife was used without regard to sentiment, and
some of the best companies in the regiment were the victims.</p>

<p>It is more pleasant to close this story in 1815, when the
Corps was at the greatest strength attained since its birth,&mdash;a
hundred years before. Suffice it to say that from 114
<span class="sidenote">Kane’s
List.</span>
troops and companies in that year, it fell to 79 before 1819,
and even these were mere ghosts or skeletons of their former
selves. For nearly thirty years, after 1819, the history
of the Regiment was almost a blank page, and hopelessness
and depression weighed heavily on its members.</p>

<p>But 1815 is the year in which this narrative ends; nor is
it meant to close it with any gloomy foreshadowing of the
years of inaction and despondency, which rolled on with
dismal monotony, until the Regimental firmament was lit by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
the lurid fires of the Crimean struggle. In 1815 the military
reputation of England was at a maximum. She possessed
an army which had graduated with honours in the sternest
school, and a General to whose words the Sovereigns of
Europe listened with deference. Determination, single-mindedness,
and an exalted sense of duty were the qualities
which had animated the Duke of Wellington through his
whole career. Their reward was found in his successes; and
his successes were crowned in Paris. Imperfections exist in
the most able, and even in the most conscientious; and
England’s greatest General was certainly no exception to this
rule. But, if we allow for the irritation caused by frequent and
injudicious interference,&mdash;and for occasional hastiness, which
led him to speak without always testing the accuracy of his
information,&mdash;we must admit the Duke of Wellington to
have been the most perfect type of an English soldier ever
presented in the pages of our history. When, however, the
Artilleryman seeks for something that is genial and lovable
in the soldiers of that victorious age,&mdash;he turns from the
cold and undemonstrative Chief, and dwells fondly on the men
who had by their exertions raised Artillery, as a science, to
an unprecedented point, and had elevated with it the Corps
<span class="sidenote">Hime.</span>
they loved. The researches of a recent writer have brought
to light words spoken by a chivalrous enemy, which should
be emblazoned in the records of every battery, and impressed
<span class="sidenote">General
Foy.</span>
on the mind of every Artilleryman:&mdash;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Les canonniers
Anglais se distinguent entre les autres soldats par le bon
esprit qui les anime. En bataille leur activité est judicieuse,
leur coup d’œil parfait, et leur bravoure stoïque.”</span>
Of the latter three qualities, two may be ensured by diligence
in peace, and the third is tested by the difficulties and
dangers of war: but the history of the great and the good
in the Corps must indeed have been feebly written, if it do
not strengthen among its living members that which exists
now, as of old, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“le bon esprit qui les anime.”</span>

<div class="sidenote">Jones’s
Sieges,
vol. i.,
p. 222.</div>

<p>In the first volume of Sir J. T. Jones’s ‘Sieges in Spain,’
edited by Lieutenant-Colonel H. D. Jones, the following
passage occurs: “It becomes the duty of the Editor to
remove the very injurious and unmerited censure cast upon
the officers of Engineers who were employed at the Siege
of Badajoz, and which is contained in a letter from the
Earl of Wellington to Major-General G. Murray, a copy
of which is published in the collection of the Despatches
of the Duke of Wellington.”</p>

<p>The Editor then proceeds to prove, most clearly and successfully,
that the hasty language used with reference to the
Engineers was not only injurious, but also unmerited.</p>

<p>The same great General is also convicted by his admirer,
Napier, of hasty inconsistency in his private correspondence.
It was of the very same troops, and referring to precisely
the same time, that the Duke of Wellington wrote in one
<span class="sidenote">Napier’s
‘Peninsular
War,’
vol. vi.,
p. 166.</span>
letter: “The soldiers are detestable for everything but
fighting; and the officers are as culpable as the men:” and
in another, “that he thought he could go anywhere, and do
anything with the army that fought on the Pyrenees.”</p>

<p>Well might Napier say that the vehemence of the censure
in the former of the quotations is inconsistent with the
latter, and now celebrated, observation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span></p>

<p>It now becomes the painful, and yet necessary, task of the
chronicler of the services of the Royal Artillery, as of the
member of the sister corps already quoted, “to remove a very
injurious and unmerited censure” cast upon the Regiment,
in a private letter, written by the Duke of Wellington, with
reference to its conduct at the battle of Waterloo. Of this
letter’s existence the world was ignorant until the year
1872, when it made its appearance in a volume of ‘Supplementary
Letters and Despatches of the Duke of Wellington,’
published by his son. The sensation which it was certain
<span class="sidenote">
‘Athenæum.’</span>
to produce was foretold by one of the reviews, and was
anticipated by the noble Editor. As, however, his object
was to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth, the present Duke did not feel justified in withholding
from publication any letter, which was found among his
father’s papers, merely because it might wound the feelings
of its readers, or give a new interpretation of historical events.
And although the indiscriminate publication of a man’s
private correspondence is a doubtful tribute to his memory,
and a severe test of his reputation, it is, on the whole,
fortunate for the Royal Artillery that this letter made its
appearance, while officers were yet alive, who had taken
a part in the battle referred to in its pages, and clearly
remembered its details.</p>

<p>The original letter was written by the Duke of Wellington
to Lord Mulgrave, then Master-General of the Ordnance, on
the 21st December, 1815. The published letter was from a
copy, or draft, of the original, which was found among the
Duke’s papers. The hope that perhaps there may have been
modifications in the original, which did not exist in the draft
or copy, disappears before the fact that Lord Mulgrave’s
answer was also found among the Duke’s papers, expressing his
amazement at the letter he had just received. The harsh
statements in the published draft, or copy, were doubtless,
therefore, left in the original when forwarded. The circumstances
under which the letter were written were as
follows. The field officers of the Royal Artillery, who had
been present at Waterloo, applied to the Master-General
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
<span class="sidenote">‘Hist.
R. A.,’
vol. ii.
p. 356.</span>
of the Ordnance for the same pensions for service as had
been given after Vittoria. The indignation with which the
Duke of Wellington had heard of the Vittoria pensions was
well known in the Regiment: nor can one avoid sympathising
with him. Discipline must suffer if the power of rewarding,
or recommending for reward, be independent of the
commander of the forces as a channel. The special interference
of the Ordnance on behalf of the Corps, which was
their <i>protégé</i>, was not merely a breach of discipline, to which
a man like the Duke of Wellington was not likely tamely to
submit, but must have had an irritating effect on the rest
of the army. When, therefore, the field officers of Artillery
present at Waterloo resolved to apply for the same reward as
had been given after Vittoria, they had the alternative before
them of making their request through the Duke, basing it
upon a precedent which was detestable in his eyes, or of
availing themselves of the dual government, under which
they served, by making a direct application to the Ordnance.
Of these alternatives, the former would have been the more
soldierlike, but was not likely to succeed: the latter, therefore,
was unfortunately adopted.</p>

<p>The application was not couched in a very official form,
nor was it officially pressed by Sir George Wood. The only
reference to it which can be traced in that officer’s correspondence
is in a letter announcing Major Lloyd’s death,
<span class="sidenote">Dated
Paris,
3 Aug,
1815.</span>
in which he writes:&mdash;“Should Lord Mulgrave, in his goodness,
be inclined to grant pensions to field officers and
captains commanding brigades, similar to the battle of
Vittoria, I hope and trust that the late Major Lloyd’s
family may receive the benefit his service deserved.”
The precedent of Vittoria was not quite a parallel case to
that of Waterloo: in the former every brigade with the
army had been in action; while, in the latter, some had been
detached. It seems to have been on this distinction, mainly,
that Lord Mulgrave based his refusal to grant the reward.
To justify himself, he referred the matter to the Duke of
Wellington, who approved of the refusal, as might have been
expected, but did so in terms which reveal an inaccuracy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
and a hastiness, unparalleled in his Grace’s correspondence.
He wrote as follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3>“<span class="smcap">To the Earl of Mulgrave.</span></h3>

<p class="author">
“Paris, <i>21st December, 1815</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>“I received yesterday your Lordship’s letter of the 10th,
regarding the claim of the field officers of the Artillery, present
in the battle of Waterloo, to the same measure of favour
granted to those in the battle of Vittoria.</p>

<p>“In my opinion you have done quite right to refuse to grant
this favour, and that you have founded your refusal on the
best grounds. I cannot recommend that you should depart
from the ground you have taken. To tell you the truth, I
was not very well pleased with the Artillery in the battle of
Waterloo.</p>

<p>“The army was formed in squares immediately on the slope
of the rising ground, on the summit of which the Artillery
was placed, with orders not to engage with artillery, but to
fire only when bodies of troops came under their fire. It
was very difficult to get them to obey this order. The
French cavalry charged, and were formed on the same ground
with our Artillery in general, within a few yards of our guns.
In some instances they were in actual possession of our guns.
We could not expect the artillerymen to remain at their
guns in such a case. But I had a right to expect that the
officers and men of the Artillery would do as I did, and as all
the staff did, that is, to take shelter in the squares of the
Infantry till the French cavalry should be driven off the
ground, either by our Cavalry or Infantry. But they did no
such thing; they ran off the field entirely, taking with them
limbers, ammunition, and everything: and when, in a few
minutes, we had driven off the French cavalry, and had regained
our ground and our guns, and could have made good
use of our artillery, we had no artillerymen to fire them;
and, in point of fact, I should have had no Artillery during
the whole of the latter part of the action, if I had not kept
a reserve in the commencement.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span></p>

<p>“Mind, my dear Lord, I do not mean to complain; but what
I have above mentioned is a fact known to many; and it
would not do to reward a corps under such circumstances.
The Artillery, like others, behaved most gallantly; but when
a misfortune of this kind has occurred, a corps must not be
rewarded. It is on account of these little stories, which
must come out, that I object to all the propositions to write
what is called a history of the battle of Waterloo.</p>

<p>“If it is to be a history, it must be the truth, and the whole
truth, or it will do more harm than good, and will give as
many false notions of what a battle is, as other romances of
the same description have. But if a true history is written,
what will become of the reputation of half of those who have
acquired reputation, and who deserve it for their gallantry,
but who, if their mistakes and casual misconduct were made
public, would not be so well thought of? I am certain that
if I were to enter into a critical discussion of everything that
occurred from the 14th to the 19th June, I could show ample
reasons for not entering deeply into these subjects.</p>

<p>“The fact is, that the army that gained the battle of
Waterloo was an entirely new one, with the exception of
some of the old Spanish troops. Their inexperience occasioned
the mistakes they committed, the rumours they circulated
that all was destroyed, because they themselves ran
away, and the mischief which ensued; but they behaved
gallantly, and I am convinced, if the thing was to be done
again, they would show what it was to have the experience
of even one battle.</p>

<p>“P.S.&mdash;I am very well pleased with the field officers for not
liking to have their application referred to me. They know
the reason I have not to recommend them for a favour.”</p>

<p>In discussing this letter, it is proposed to examine what
may be termed the internal and external evidences of its
inaccuracy, commencing with the former.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In his despatch of the 19th June, 1815, announcing the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
victory, the Duke wrote: “The Artillery and Engineer departments
were conducted <i>much to my satisfaction</i> by Colonel
Sir George Wood and Colonel Smyth.” Evidently, then, the
fact “known to many” of the Artillerymen running off the
ground had not been known to him when he wrote his
despatch, or he could hardly have described the Artillery
department as having been conducted much to his satisfaction.
Nor does the fact, even when made known to him,
seem to have produced the effect upon his Grace’s mind,
which misconduct among the troops under his command, in
the face of an enemy, would at any other time have instantly
created. Were not the genuineness of the letter beyond all
question, some of the contradictions and inconsistencies in it
would have justified the reader in pronouncing it a forgery,
invented to throw discredit on the reputation of England’s
greatest General. Was it the Duke of Wellington who,
after writing the words, “They ran off the field entirely,
taking with them limbers, ammunition, and everything,”
proceeded to say, “The Artillery, like others, behaved most
gallantly”? Was it the Iron Duke who, after saying, “In
point of fact, I should have had no Artillery during the
whole of the latter part of the action, if I had not kept a
reserve in the commencement,” went on, with the resignation
of a martyr, to say, “Mind, my dear Lord, I do not mean
to complain”? The inconsistency with his known character
is astounding.</p>

<p>After describing the disappearance of his Artillerymen,
and the straits to which he was consequently reduced, he
proceeds in this letter to say: “It would not do to reward a
corps under such circumstances.” If he were correctly
informed as to these circumstances, there would not have
been a single individual in the whole of his army who would
have differed from him as to his conclusion. But, unfortunately
for him, he endeavoured to prove too much. Not
content with giving, as a reason for withholding rewards, an
assertion which, if accurate, would have more than justified
him, he must needs strengthen an already overwhelming
case by a mysterious insinuation in the postscript of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
letter, respecting some other unexpressed ground of his
displeasure, with which the field officers must be familiar as
a cause for his refusing to recommend them for reward.
Was there not, in this piling of Pelion upon Ossa, some
consciousness of the necessity of self-justification?</p>

<p>But these are merely striking self-contradictions and
inconsistencies in style. It is when the truth of the
statements made by the Duke in this letter is inquired into,
that one stands astounded at the inaccuracy of his informants,
and the hasty assumptions of the writer himself.
The letter is so involved,&mdash;so confusing in its mixed references
to the Artillery and to the army generally,&mdash;so laden
with marvellous didactic sentences as to the propriety of
writing a history of the battle of Waterloo,&mdash;that it is not
always easy to ascertain the connection between argument
and conclusion. So slovenly, indeed, is the style at the end
of the letter, that it reads as if the whole army ran away!
Let two sentences be reproduced: “The fact is, that the
army that gained the battle of Waterloo was an entirely
new one, with the exception of some of the old Spanish
troops. Their inexperience occasioned the mistakes they
committed, the rumours they circulated that all was
destroyed, because they themselves ran away, and the
mischiefs which ensued; but they behaved gallantly.” ...
One rises from a perusal of these words with a bewildered
feeling that gallant behaviour among troops is identical
with running away;&mdash;and that the whole army, with the
exception of some of the old Spanish troops, exhibited their
gallantry in this singular manner. But, as the statement,
that the army was entirely a new one, is used apparently in
the first instance to account for the Artillery running off the
field, it may be interesting to glance at the troops and
brigades, whose inexperience seemed&mdash;in the Duke’s mind as
he wrote&mdash;to have made their flight almost natural.</p>

<p>Of the eight troops of Horse Artillery present at the
battle of Waterloo, five were the old tried troops of the
Peninsula, whose gallant services had been recorded year after
year by the Duke’s own hand: Sir Hew Ross’s, Sir Robert
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
Gardiner’s, Colonel Webber Smith’s, Major Beane’s, and
Major Bull’s. A sixth, Captain Whinyates’s, was the famous
Rocket Troop of Leipsic; and of the other two, one had
fought at Buenos Ayres, and the other in Walcheren. It
was to one of these latter and more inexperienced troops,
Captain Mercer’s, that the victory at one period of the day
<span class="sidenote">Battalion
Records of
the Royal
Artillery.</span>
was due. With regard to the field brigades of this new
army, it would seem that Major Rogers’s company had been
engaged for two years past in the operations in Holland,
and had been in the Walcheren Expedition previously; that
Captain Sinclair’s brigade had been at Copenhagen, Corunna,
and Walcheren; Captain Sandham’s at Copenhagen
and Walcheren; Major Lloyd’s at Walcheren; and that
Captain Bolton’s, the only brigade without war service,
happened to be the one whose effect in breaking the head of
the columns of the Imperial Guard has become historical,&mdash;and
whose inexperience would therefore hardly appear to
have been very detrimental. From this statement it is
evident that the Artillery element in the Duke’s army at
Waterloo was veteran, rather than new;&mdash;for, if the troops
and brigades possessed such records as are given above,
much more did the majority of the field and staff officers
present deserve the title of veterans.</p>

<p>But the next inaccuracy is more unpardonable; and the
informants of the Duke on the subject were guilty of errors
for which there was no excuse. “In point of fact,” wrote
the Duke, “I should have had no Artillery during the whole
of the latter part of the action, if I had not kept a reserve
at the commencement.” Fortunately for the exposure of
this grave inaccuracy, there is no point on which there is
more full and official information both in Sir George Wood’s
and other despatches, and more detailed notice in private
correspondence, than on the subject of the Artillery reserves
at Waterloo. As stated in the last chapter of this volume,
it was composed of Sir Hew Ross’s and Major Beane’s
troops of Horse Artillery, and Captain Sinclair’s Field
Brigade. So far was this force from being kept in reserve,
and being brought forward providentially at the end of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
action to replace the runaways, that it was actually in action&mdash;every
gun&mdash;almost at the <i>commencement of the day</i>, and
suffered the heaviest losses before half-past one. By a
happy coincidence, the Artillery, which must have been
represented to the Duke as his reserve, is mentioned by
<span class="sidenote">Frazer’s
Letters,
p. 559.</span>
Sir Augustus Frazer: “Some time before this&mdash;i.e., the
massing of the second line <i>during the cavalry attacks</i>&mdash;the
Duke ordered me to bring up all the reserve Horse Artillery,
which at that moment were <i>Mercer’s</i> and <i>Bull’s
troops</i>.” But, instead of these troops being a reserve
kept, as the Duke’s letter says, “from the commencement,”&mdash;they
also had both been in action from the beginning of
the day, and Bull’s troop had actually been sent to the
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
p. 557.</span>
centre of the second line “to refit and repair disabled
carriages!”</p>

<p>The importance of this inaccuracy in the letter cannot be
overrated. If the Artillery, which the Duke admits having
had at the end of the day, was not the reserve, which he
had kept in hand,&mdash;and it certainly was not,&mdash;what was it?
The asserted flight of the gunners with their limbers and
ammunition hangs upon the truth, or otherwise, of there
having been reserves in hand to replace them. But the fact
of these reserves having been in action from the beginning
of the day is incontestable; and is proved by the correspondence
of Sir Hew Ross, who commanded one of the reserve
troops, as well as by the official and semi-official correspondence
of others. It is possible that the arrival of Sir Robert
Gardiner’s troop, with Vivian’s and Vandeleur’s brigades,
from the left of the line, at the end of the day, may have
deceived the Duke’s informant, and led him to imagine that
it was fresh Artillery from the reserve. That it was not so,
however, but merely moved with the division to which it was
attached, is a matter of fact; and at no time in the day was
this troop ever in reserve. Therefore, in a vital point, the
Duke’s letter is unquestionably inaccurate.</p>

<p>The next statement in the letter, which demands scrutiny
is the following: “The Artillery was placed with orders
not to engage with artillery, but to fire only when bodies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
of troops came under their fire. It was very difficult to
get them to obey this order.” Sir John Bloomfield, who
was on Sir George Wood’s staff, carried this order to all the
troops and brigades, and is confident that, with one exception,
it was rigidly obeyed. He remembers that the Duke
saw a French gun struck by a shot from one of the English
batteries,&mdash;and, under the impression that it came from
Captain Sandham’s brigade, he sent orders to have that
officer placed in arrest. This was not done, some satisfactory
explanation having been given,&mdash;relieving Captain Sandham
of the disobedience. Singularly enough, the offender was
never discovered, until, in 1870, with the publication of
General Mercer’s Diary, came the confession of the crime.
<span class="sidenote">‘Mercer’s
Diary,’
vol. i.
p. 301.</span>
“About this time, being impatient of standing idle, and
annoyed by the batteries on the Nivelle road, I ventured
to commit a folly, for which I should have paid dearly had
our Duke chanced to be in our part of the field. I ventured
to disobey orders, and open a slow, deliberate fire at
the battery, thinking, with my 9-pounders, soon to silence
his 4-pounders.” As Captain Mercer’s troop was placed
near Sandham’s brigade at this time, it is evident that this
occurrence, and that mentioned by Sir John Bloomfield, are
identical. Sir John, whose duties carried him to all parts of
the field, and whose recollection of the day is as clear as
possible, asserts positively, that in no other instance was the
order disobeyed; and it will be seen from accounts, both
French and English, to be quoted hereafter, that the order
to fire upon bodies of troops approaching was literally obeyed
with the most marked results. Was it, then, quite worthy
of the Duke of Wellington to reason from the particular to
the general, and to visit the disobedience of one officer
<span class="sidenote">Colonel
Gardiner,
R.H.A.</span>
upon a whole corps? As has been well said by the son of
one of the bravest Artillery officers on the field, Sir Robert
Gardiner: “If a Regiment of Infantry had run away, and
all the others had behaved splendidly,&mdash;would the whole
arm have been similarly condemned? Would it not have
been more just to reward those who deserved it?”</p>

<p>The mention of reward suggests the next amazing inconsistency
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
in the Duke’s letter,&mdash;and makes it almost certain
that it was written on receiving some subsequent information
from another source,&mdash;not from his personal observation. In
this letter, dated six months after the battle, he wrote: “It
would not do to reward a corps under such circumstances;”
and again: “The field officers know the reason I have not
to recommend them for a favour.” How are these sentences
to be reconciled with the following extract from the
‘London Gazette,’ which immediately followed the battle,
and was issued while all its details must have been fresh
in the Duke’s recollection?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dated

<p>It is unnecessary to add that the boon service granted for
the battle of Waterloo, and the Waterloo medals, were given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
to the Artillery present, without exception. It would, therefore,
appear that for a corps which did not deserve to be
rewarded, it did not fare badly; and that its merits were
only called in question when pensions based on an unpopular
precedent were asked for. It is also impossible that the
Duke could have been so generous in his original recommendations,
had he known of his own personal observation,
that which he stated in his letter of the 21st December, and
which must now receive grave consideration; the asserted
flight from the field of battle of many of the Artillerymen
with their limbers, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In ascertaining the unmistakable inaccuracy of this cruel
and hasty assertion, which must have been made by the Duke
of Wellington on the most worthless evidence, the advantage
of the late publication of the letter has become apparent.
Much of the evidence, which will be adduced to rebut it,
was not written with the view of meeting such an accusation,
but is merely extracted from the simple narrative of a battle,
in which the facts are stated without any idea of their being
questioned. Had the Duke’s letter been published while the
writers of many of the letters to be quoted were alive, their
answers would not have had half the historical value they
now possess, for they would have been regarded as the
pleadings of interested defendants. The statements of disinterested
historians will conclude this brief argument.</p>

<p>When the celebrated charges of the French cavalry at
Waterloo took place, the English guns lined the crest of the
position, and the Infantry was formed in squares in their
rear. The order given by the Duke was that the Artillerymen
should stand to their guns as long as possible, and then
take refuge in the Infantry squares; and that <i>the limbers
should be sent behind the squares</i>. This order was carried to
the various batteries by Sir John Bloomfield, and was obeyed
to the letter. “The idea of six limbers,” writes Colonel
Gardiner, “with six horses in each limber, going into a
<span class="sidenote">Communicated
by
Sir J.
Bloomfield.</span>
suare of Infantry, was of course an impossibility, and
never contemplated.” The gunners had cartouche-bags
slung round them, containing ammunition, and invariably,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
with the exception of those of Captain Mercer’s troop, took
refuge in the adjacent squares, or under the bayonets of the
kneeling ranks. When the cavalry retired, on each occasion
the gunners ran out, and, as a rule, the guns were in action
against the retreating cavalry before they had gone sixty
yards. The delay of a few moments occurred once or twice,
while shot were being brought from the limbers; and Sir John
Bloomfield remembers an expression of impatience escaping
the Duke on one of these occasions. Nor was it unnatural.
“To lose,” writes Colonel Gardiner, “an opportunity of
inflicting destruction on the French cavalry, directly they
turned their backs, and before they could get out of the
range of canister, must have been very tantalizing.” But
that the delay ever exceeded a few moments, or that a single
limber ever left the ground, Sir John Bloomfield is confident
is an utter delusion. Such an occurrence as is described in
the Duke’s letter could not have happened without being
well known. The Duke himself said, “It is known to many;”
and yet Sir John lived for three years with the headquarter
staff in Paris, and never heard even an insinuation on the
subject. Another Waterloo survivor writes on this point:
<span class="sidenote">General B.
Cuppage,
R.A., to the
Author.</span>
“I never did hear, nor any one else, of the artillery misbehaving
at Waterloo. Sir Alexander Dickson took me
with him into Brussels after the battle. We saw every
officer who came in, and the action was in every part the
constant theme of conversation, both in our private, as well
as more general moments. Had anything bearing such a
term taken place, it would certainly have been canvassed.
I was in daily conversation with our wounded in the town.
Surely I may say, but that the Duke of Wellington says
it, it is as cruel as it is unjust.”</p>

<p>If known to many, it could hardly have escaped the
commanding officer of the corps most interested. The fact
that Sir George Wood did not write his despatches to the
Ordnance until the 24th June,&mdash;that during the six days’
interval since the battle he had been constantly with the
Duke,&mdash;and yet that he could write as follows, proves most
clearly that the Duke himself cannot have been aware of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
what he afterwards wrote to Lord Mulgrave, and that his letter
must have been based on subsequent malicious and worthless
testimony. The wording of Sir George Wood’s letters have
an almost providential bearing on the point at issue; and
could not have been used, had there been even a doubt as to
the conduct of the Corps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dated Le
Cateau,
24 June,

<p>“I beg leave,” he wrote, “to call the attention of His
Lordship the Master-General to the skill and intrepidity
so eminently displayed by the British and German
Artillery. The accompanying return of their loss will
show how much they participated in the action, and I can
assure His Lordship the Master-General, that, notwithstanding
their being outnumbered by the Artillery of the
enemy, <i>their merits never shone more conspicuous</i> than on
this occasion. It now remains for me to express with
much pleasure and satisfaction that <i>every officer and man
in the field of battle did their duty</i>.”</p>

<p>With his despatch, Sir George wrote a private letter to
General Macleod, in which the following passage occurs:
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.</span>
“I do assure you, I have not words to express the extreme
good conduct of the Corps. All exerted themselves, both
officers and men, and such a conflict of guns never was in
the memory of man.”</p>

<p>But there are recorded, also, the opinions of the Generals of
other arms, under whose immediate command various troops
and brigades served: and who would have known had any
misconduct occurred among them, better than the Duke
himself, on account of the more limited field of their
observation. General Colquhoun Grant’s complimentary
<span class="sidenote"><i>Vide</i>
p. 436.</span>
order with reference to Colonel Webber Smith’s Troop has
already been quoted. The following order was issued by
<span class="sidenote">Dated
Nivelle,
20 June,
1815.</span>
Lord Hill: “The highly distinguished conduct of the
2nd Division, and Colonel Mitchell’s Brigade of the
4th Division, who had the good fortune to be employed in
the memorable action, merit His Lordship’s highest approbation;
and he begs that ... Colonel Gold, commanding
Royal Artillery of the 2nd Corps, ... Major
Sympher, commanding a troop of Horse Artillery, King’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
German Legion, Captain Napier (to whose lot it fell to
command the 9-pounder Brigade, 2nd Division, on the
death of Captain Bolton), will accept his best thanks for
their exemplary conduct, and will be pleased to convey
his sentiments to the officers, non-commissioned officers,
and men under their command.”</p>

<p>The following extract from the 5th Division orders, by
Sir James Kempt, speaks equally favourably of another
<span class="sidenote">Dated
19 June,
1815.</span>
brigade: “The British Brigade of Artillery commanded by
Major Rogers, and the Hanoverian Brigade commanded by
Major Heisse, were most nobly served, and judiciously
placed; and these officers and men will be pleased to
accept of his&mdash;i.e. the Major-General’s&mdash;particular thanks
for their service.”</p>

<p>References to the services of other brigades, and of the
Horse Artillery, by the officers of the Corps under whom
they served, have already been quoted; and in every case
commendation of the warmest description was passed upon
them. The following quotation from Sir Augustus Frazer’s
correspondence is interesting here, as asserting what was
denied by the Duke in his letter to Lord Mulgrave, that the
<span class="sidenote">Frazer’s
Letters,
p. 559.</span>
men took shelter in the squares. “The repeated charges of
the enemy’s noble cavalry were similar to the first: each
was fruitless. Not an infantry soldier moved; and, on
each charge, abandoning their guns, our men sheltered
themselves between the flanks of the squares. Twice,
however, the enemy tried to charge in front; these
attempts were entirely frustrated by the fire of the guns,
wisely reserved till the hostile squadrons were within
twenty yards of the muzzles. In this, the cool and quiet
steadiness of the troops of Horse Artillery was very
creditable.” This was written two days after the battle;
and no man had better opportunity of seeing the conduct of
his Corps than the writer. Every historian of the battle
endorses this version: and the testimony of an impartial
historian always represents the carefully sifted testimony of
many. Sir Edward Cust, the laborious military annalist,
writes thus: “Suddenly some bugles were heard to sound,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
and all the Artillerymen, abandoning their guns and
tumbrils, ran back into the infantry squares.... In a
moment, the Artillery gunners quitted the protection of the
squares, and running up to their guns, which were most
of them ready loaded, opened heavily with grape and with
every species of projectile.... The cavaliers again
mounted the plateau; again the gunners abandoned their
guns, and took refuge within the squares.” Creasy writes:
“As the French receded from each attack, the British
Artillerymen rushed forward from the centre of the
squares, where they had taken refuge, and plied their
guns on the retiring horsemen.” The same is the account
given by every historian of the battle. Were they all
dreaming? or were they in some conspiracy to conceal the
truth? And if so, did the Duke himself join it? In the
thirty-seven years of his life after Waterloo, he never
contradicted the numerous accounts of the battle, all of
which agreed in their statement of the eminent services of
the Artillery. Was it consistent in one, who professed
belief in an occurrence “known to many,” and who gave
that belief as a ground for the refusal of favours,&mdash;to allow
such passages as the following to be published without
contradiction, unless indeed he had subsequently ascertained
the worthlessness of his information?<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>  “There,” wrote
<span class="sidenote">‘Battle of
Waterloo,’
by G. R.
Gleig,
Chaplain-General.</span>
Gleig, “every arm did its duty; the Artillery from the
beginning to the close of the day.” Again: “In the
course of the day every battery was brought into action;
and not even the records of that noble Corps can point to
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.</span>
an occasion in which they better did their work.” Sir
James Shaw Kennedy, in summing up his description of the
<span class="sidenote">Sir J. S.
Kennedy’s
‘Waterloo,’
p. 179.</span>
battle, says: “Full scope was thus given for the British
Cavalry and Artillery to display their surpassing gallantry
and excellence; and they did not fail to display these
qualities in an eminent degree.”</p>

<p>But it has been admitted that Captain Mercer’s troop was
an exception to the others; that his men did not take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
<span class="sidenote">Mercer’s
‘Diary,’
p. 312.</span>
shelter within the Infantry squares. Let him tell his own
story. “Sir Augustus, pointing out our position between
two squares of Brunswick Infantry, left us with injunctions
to remember the Duke’s orders (to retire within the
squares) and to economise our ammunition. The Brunswickers
were falling fast ... these were the very boys
whom I had but yesterday seen throwing away their arms
and fleeing, panic-stricken, from the very sound of our
horses’ feet.... Every moment I feared they would
again throw down their arms and flee.... To have sought
refuge amongst men in such a state were madness; the
very moment our men ran from their guns, I was convinced,
would be the signal for their disbanding. We had better,
then, fall at our posts than in such a situation.” He
accordingly made his men stand to the guns, until the cavalry
were within a few feet of them; and on each occasion the
havoc he wrought among them&mdash;as he drove them back&mdash;was
frightful. The immense heap of dead, lying in front of
Mercer’s guns, was such that Sir Augustus Frazer said that,
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
p. 343.</span>
in riding over the field next day, he “could plainly distinguish
the position of C Troop from the opposite height by
the dark mass, which, even from that distance, formed a
remarkable feature in the field.”</p>

<p>Captain Mercer’s men, therefore, were those who did not
obey the Duke’s order. It was a fortunate act of disobedience,
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
p. 313.</span>
and it saved the Brunswickers; but Captain Mercer was
severely punished for it. He was not recommended for
brevet rank; and, on his appointment by Lord Mulgrave to
a vacant Troop, he was deprived of it by the Duke of Wellington,
who got it summarily reduced in 1816. Did, however,
the limbers of Captain Mercer’s battery ever leave the
ground? That they did not, can be shown most clearly. In
his diary, he describes the state of his Troop after a heavy
fire, to which it was exposed <i>after</i> the charges of the French
<span class="sidenote">Ibid.
p. 326.</span>
cavalry. In the description, he says: “The guns came together
in a confused heap, the trails crossing each other,
and the whole <i>dangerously near the limbers</i> and ammunition
waggons.” The same description also proves that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
frightful losses suffered by the troop took place during the
very time when, according to the Duke’s letter, the men
and limbers would have been off the field. In going to take
up the position, they moved at a gallop, and in so compact a
body, that the Duke cried out: “Ah! that’s the way I
like to see Horse Artillery move!” In a short time, such
was the havoc committed among men and horses, that Captain
Mercer wrote: “I sighed for my poor troop; it was already
a wreck.”</p>

<p>With regard to the insinuation as to the lack of artillery
at the end of the battle, it is shown clearly by Siborne, in
his model of the battle as it was at a quarter before 8 <small>P.M.</small>,
that thirteen Troops and Brigades of the Royal Artillery
were in action, when the final attack took place; <i>this being
the entire number with the army</i>. Of these, some were so
crippled by losses&mdash;as Mercer’s was&mdash;that they were unable
to join in the pursuit; and possibly some recollection of
this fact may have been in the Duke’s mind when he wrote.
That the artillery fire, however, at the end of the day was
slack from the cause stated in the Duke’s letter is an utter
mistake; nor do the French seem to have found it very
slack, as will be seen presently.</p>

<p>One word before appealing to a few other historians. If
such conduct had taken place, as is described in the letter
under consideration, it would have been bruited over the
whole army. Concealment, or collusion, would have been
impossible; enquiries would have been officially instituted.
To believe that such an occurrence could have been kept
quiet, requires a considerably greater stretch of credulity,
than to believe that the Duke of Wellington was misinformed.
In fact, that such unanimity of testimony to one version,
and such a general agreement to be silent to another, should
be possible, unless the former were true, and the latter
imaginary, would be nothing short of a miracle. One or
two miracles of this description would demolish all belief
in history.</p>

<p>In the earliest and most detailed account of the Battle of
Waterloo, the tenth edition of which was published in 1817,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
and which is called ‘The Battle of Waterloo, also of Ligny,
and Quatre Bras, described by the series of accounts published
by authority, by a near observer;’ edited by Captain
G. Jones, the following passage occurs: “No account
yet published of the battle, seen by the Editor, has mentioned
in adequate terms the effect of our artillery at
Waterloo&mdash;no <i>English</i> account at least. <i>The enemy felt</i> it,
and in their manner of expressing themselves have passed
the greatest compliments. A French account, given in
our preceding pages, says: ‘The English artillery made
<i>dreadful</i> havoc in our ranks.’... ‘The Imperial Guard
made several charges, but was constantly repulsed,
<i>crushed by a terrible artillery, that each minute seemed to
multiply</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> These invincible grenadiers <i>beheld the grape-shot
make day through their ranks</i>; they closed promptly
and coolly their shattered ranks.”... “In proportion as
they ranged up the eminence, and darted forward on the
squares, which occupied its summit, <i>the Artillery vomited
death upon them, and killed them in masses</i>.... In an
account given by an officer of the ‘Northumberland,’ of
Napoleon’s conversation on board that ship, he says: ‘Bonaparte
gives great credit to our Infantry and Artillery.’”
Again: “The artillery on both sides was well served, but
Bonaparte had upwards of 250 pieces in the field. Notwithstanding
our inferiority in this arm, which was still
more apparent from the size of the enemy’s guns (being
12-pounders, ours only 9 and 6), than from their numbers,
ours were so well fought, that I believe it is allowed by
all they did equal execution.... See also the account of
Captain Bolton and Napier’s Brigade of Foot Artillery,
from which it appears the Artillery had turned the enemy,
previous to the advance of the Guards. The French displayed
the greatest rage and fury; they cursed the English
while they were fighting, and cursed the precision with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
which the English grape-shot was fired, which ‘was neither
too high nor too low, but struck right in the middle.’”</p>

<p>From the many writers who have done credit to the
exertions and courage of the Artillery at Waterloo, three
more extracts will be made.</p>

<p>In proof of the activity of the Corps at the end of the day,
the following quotation, from an author already mentioned,
<span class="sidenote">Gleig.</span>
is given. In describing the reception given to the French
Imperial Guard, he says: “The English gunners once more
plied their trade. It was positively frightful to witness
<span class="sidenote">Kennedy,
p. 142.</span>
the havoc that was occasioned in that mass.” Sir James
Shaw Kennedy also describes the strength of the British
artillery fire at the end of the day.</p>

<p>In a Paper on ‘The Campaign of Waterloo,’ which appeared
in the ‘United Service Journal,’ in 1834, the following
passage occurs: “If we admit that, during this arduous
and terrible day, the British Infantry acted up to the
right standard of soldiership, which their long career of
victory had established, it must be added that <i>the Artillery
actually surpassed all expectation</i>, high as, from their previous
conduct, that expectation naturally was. In point
of zeal and courage, the officers and men of the three
arms were of course fully upon a par; but the circumstances
of the battle were favourable to the Artillery;
and certainly the skill, spirit, gallantry, and indefatigable
exertion which they displayed, almost surpasses belief.”</p>

<p>Only one more witness will be called from the ranks of
historians. Hooper, in his work on Waterloo, to which he
devoted eight years, and in the compilation of which he used
every known authority on both sides, made use of words
which appropriately close this argument: “The Artillery,
so devoted and effective, gathered another branch from the
tree of honour.”

<span class="medium smcap">The Royal Artillery and the Magnetic Survey of
the Globe.</span></h2>

<p>After the peace of 1815 officers of Royal Artillery had little
opportunity for active employment or staff duty. Among
other officers who turned their attention to employments out
of the ordinary routine were General Sir Edward Sabine
and the late Colonel Colquhoun. The latter officer made a
voyage to the Arctic Seas as an amateur whaler, took
employment in connection with a South American Mining
Company, and, before his appointment to the Carriage
Department, in which he did most excellent service for
many years&mdash;till nearly the date of the Crimean war&mdash;commanded
the Artillery of Sir de Lacy Evans’s Spanish
Legion, and was employed with the naval expeditions sent
to Spain and to the coast of Syria.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Sabine began a long scientific career by
accompanying the late Sir Edward Parry to the North Polar
Seas in 1819-20, as the scientific observer of his expedition.
His interest in scientific pursuits, and especially in the
determination of the figure of the Earth and in the science
of terrestrial magnetism, has continued to the present date.
He filled the office of Secretary of the Royal Society from 1828
to 1829, that of Foreign Secretary from 1845 to 1850, and
that of Treasurer from 1850 to 1861; and he was President
from 1861 to 1871, when he retired from office. In 1839,
the Royal Society and British Association procured the
sanction of the Government for a naval expedition to the
Antarctic Seas, and for the establishment of four fixed
magnetic and meteorological observatories at four stations
widely apart, namely, Hobarton, in Van Diemen’s Land,
Cape Town, St. Helena, and Toronto. The station at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
Hobarton was undertaken by the Admiralty, and given to
officers of the late Sir James Ross’s Antarctic expedition.
The establishment of the other observatories was, under the
authority of the Master-General and Board of Ordnance,
entrusted to Royal Artillery officers, with non-commissioned
officers as assistants, who were employed under the orders of
the Deputy Adjutant-General and of Sir Edward (then
Major) Sabine, as an ordinary staff duty. The officers
successively employed were Lieutenants (now Major-Generals)
F. Eardley-Wilmot, W. J. Smythe, J. H. Lefroy, C. J. B.
Riddell, and H. Clerk; Lieutenant (now Colonel) Younghusband
and the late Colonel H. J. Strange.</p>

<p>The magnetic instruments employed, of singular elegance
and precision, were designed by the Rev. Humphrey Lloyd
(now Provost) of Trinity College, Dublin, by whom the
officers were instructed in their manipulation at the Magnetic
Observatory in the College grounds, the only one then
existing in the United Kingdom. The discovery which had
been made of the simultaneous manifestation of magnetical
disturbance over a wide extent of the globe rendered it
desirable that the observations at all the stations should be
taken at the same moment of absolute time; and, in compliment
to Professor Gauss, to whom magnetic science was
so deeply indebted, Goettingen time was universally adopted.
Observations of the three elements&mdash;Declination, Horizontal
Force, and Vertical Force&mdash;were made every two hours, day
and night, and with such strictness that, if by any accident
the right moment was lost, the observation was entered in
red ink, with a note of the number of seconds elapsed. Once
a month, on what was called “Term Day,” the observations
were prosecuted at intervals of a few minutes for twenty-four
hours uninterruptedly, and a similar course was adopted
whenever a magnetic storm declared itself, and persevered
in until the storm passed away, a period, occasionally, of as
much as thirty hours.</p>

<p>The observatories were established originally for three
years, but were continued, in the case of the Cape and
St. Helena, for a second term of the same length, and in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
that of Toronto for three terms. At the conclusion of these
terms the St. Helena observatory was discontinued, and
the remaining observatories were taken over by the local
governments.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Clerk commenced his magnetic employment by
a cruise in the Antarctic Seas for a magnetic survey. Lieutenant
Lefroy carried out a magnetic survey of a considerable
portion of the Hudson’s Bay territories, and Lieutenant
Eardley-Wilmot a survey of the Cape Colony.</p>

<p>The observations made at the Ordnance and Naval Observatories
have been published under the direction of Sir
Edward Sabine, who has had an office for the purpose at
<span class="sidenote">In November,
1871.</span>
Woolwich, which has been subsequently removed to the
Kew Observatory.</p>

<p>The brief summary given above of the operations which
earned for so many Artillery officers the blue riband of
Science,&mdash;Fellowship of the Royal Society,&mdash;would establish
to a great extent that which its most distinguished officers
have always sought to secure for the Regiment,&mdash;a scientific
reputation. But in the career of Sir Edward Sabine, so
briefly alluded to, there has been one continued proof of the
possibility of a soldier attaining the highest eminence in the
world of science. Although personally unknown to many
of his brother officers, his fame has been the pride of all;
and has been felt to reflect a lustre, unprecedented in the
profession, upon the Corps of which he is a member. Many
readers of these pages will remember the reception given to
him when, with the other Colonels-Commandant, he was persuaded
during the present year to revisit the head-quarters
of the Regiment. In the enthusiasm with which he was
greeted by old and young, there was an unmistakable
evidence of an <i>esprit de corps</i>, which, while admitting the
claims of the scientific world at large upon their distinguished
comrade, yet determined that it should be known to
him that his honours were doubly dear to them because he
was one of themselves.</p>

<p>In the sketch of the Magnetic Survey of the Globe given
above, there would be a great omission if it were not stated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
how much the employment of Artillery officers in these
operations was due to the previous labours and successes of
Sir Edward Sabine. It was in 1817, two years after the
conclusion of the war, that the first Polar Expedition was
prepared. The Admiralty, to whom the preparations were
entrusted, applied to the President and Council of the Royal
Society to recommend a person who should be competent to
conduct the researches in Physics and Natural History.
General Mudge&mdash;already mentioned in this work&mdash;was then
at the head of the British Trigonometrical Survey, and was
a member of the Council of the Royal Society. It may be
here mentioned, in passing, that in those days the Artillery
and Engineers had the alternate direction of the Trigonometrical
Survey, now apparently vested exclusively in the
latter. Sir Edward Sabine was already favourably known,
not merely to General Mudge, but also to other leading
members of the Council of the Royal Society, such as
Young, Kater, Wollaston, and Davy,&mdash;on account of some
works which he had written, one being on the Birds of North
America, in which country he had served during the war of
1812-14. After passing a severe examination, with great
credit, Sir Edward Sabine’s appointment to the Polar Expedition
was sanctioned by Lord Mulgrave, then Master-General
of the Ordnance: and early in 1818 he sailed in
the ‘Isabella,’ making his first Pendulum station at Hare
Island, in Baffin’s Bay, in the spring of 1818. The results
of his experiments, then and subsequently, appeared in the
‘Philosophical Transactions,’ and in a work entitled ‘Pendulum
and other Experiments,’ published in 1825, at the
cost of Government, on the recommendation of the Duke of
Wellington, who had succeeded Lord Mulgrave as Master-General
of the Ordnance.</p>

<p>It was Sir Edward’s hope&mdash;in which, however, he was disappointed&mdash;that
a series of Pendulum experiments on the
continental surface comprised between the high Canadian
latitudes and the shores of the Mexican Sea, should also be
undertaken. He has lived, however, to see the same object
admirably accomplished on the continent of British India
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
between Cape Comorin and the Higher Himalaya, under the
able direction of Colonel Walker of the Royal (Indian) Engineers,&mdash;and
to take himself a final part in the completion of
the series, at the Kew Physical Observatory, by Captain Heaviside,
R.E., and the men of the Indian Engineers, employed
on that service by Colonel Walker. It may be said without
exaggeration that the support given by Sir Edward&mdash;as
President of the Royal Society&mdash;to Colonel Walker’s propositions,
and the earlier experiments made by himself in the
same field, have been among the highest services rendered by
any man to science. Among the many Artillery officers who,
since the peace of 1815, have sought to make a return to
their country by their devotion to physical science, Sir
Edward Sabine stands <i>facile princeps</i>:&mdash;and he has had the
satisfaction of living to see, not merely his experiments
carried to maturity, but also the inferences, which he did not
hesitate to draw with confidence from his own earlier
experiments, confirmed by the results of the labours of
others. The results of his experiments, which claimed to be
sufficiently extensive to justify the conclusion which they
<span class="sidenote">Transactions
of
Royal
Astronomical
Society.</span>
were held to establish of the measure of the ellipticity in the
northern portion of the globe, have received an increased
value since the published results of a similar series in the
southern hemisphere by Captain Henry Foster, from the fact
of their mutual agreement.</p>

<p>These earlier services of Sir Edward Sabine supplied the
ground on which the then Master-General (Lord Vivian)
justified,&mdash;and on which Sir Robert Peel, as head of the
Government, approved,&mdash;his nomination to the superintendence
of the Magnetic Observatories in 1839, fourteen
years after the publication by him of the work mentioned
above, ‘Pendulum and other Experiments.’ It was while
he held this appointment, that he directed the Magnetic
Survey of the Globe, in which so many Artillery officers had
the good fortune to take a leading part.

Two Companies of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battalions of Royal Artillery were
formed in 1771. The remaining Companies of these three Battalions and the first
six Companies of the 4th Battalion were formed at different periods from 1716 to
1757. Their identity with those Batteries now in the Service cannot be traced.</p></div>

Although anticipating matters somewhat, the Author cannot resist adding
a few words with reference to the very distinguished services of this&mdash;unhappily
defunct&mdash;company during the Indian Mutiny. No. 3 Company, 8th Battalion,
left Ceylon for India on the 11th June, 1857. It was commanded by the 2nd
Captain, Maude: Lieutenants Maitland and Dadson were the other officers. After
remaining a week in Calcutta, it proceeded on the 20th June to join the force
then being formed at Allahabad under General Havelock. The strength of the
company had been reduced by cholera, &amp;c., to 51. It marched with Havelock’s
column to Cawnpore, fighting on the way at Futtehpore, Pandu Nuddy, Avung,
and before Cawnpore. After remaining at Cawnpore a short time to recruit the
energies of his force, Havelock marched across the Ganges into Oude, hoping to
penetrate to Lucknow. He fought four actions, viz.: (1) Onao; (2) Basarat Gunj;
(3) Basarat Gunj; (4) Boorbeaki Choki, close to Basarat Gunj, having to fall back
from Basarat Gunj each time from weakness. These four actions were fought on
three successive Wednesdays&mdash;the two first on the same day. He then returned
to Cawnpore. Reinforcements under Generals Neill and Outram began to arrive,
and during the end of August and beginning of September the force increased to
3000 men. They therefore left Cawnpore on the 18th September (leaving a small
garrison), fighting at Mangalwarra and at Alumbagh, close to Lucknow, and then
prepared for the great struggle of entering the city. After coming out of Lucknow,
the company was reinforced by some Artillerymen from England, and by
Lieutenants A. Ford and S. Brown, and remained at Alumbagh under Sir James
Outram to hold the swarms of natives in Lucknow in check. During this time
frequent skirmishes and two real actions took place, all ending in the natives being
repulsed with loss. In March, Lord Clyde came up with a large force, and the
company went to take Lucknow, forming part of the siege train, and being told off
to 18-pounders, 8-inch howitzers, and 5½-inch mortars. After this, the company
was engaged in a few affairs of minor importance in Oude, until the country was
pacified.</p>

<p>If it should be the Author’s privilege to write the History of the Royal
Artillery during the Indian Mutiny, he is fortunately in a position to amplify the
above sketch with instances of individual heroism and suffering.</p></div>

In his notes on the various sieges in the Peninsula, Sir A. Dickson
frequently differs from Sir J. Jones’s well-known work. But as the latter
had more to do with engineering details, and as Sir A. Dickson’s MSS.
contain occasional marginal notes of later date, saying that his statement
is correct, and Sir J. Jones’s wrong, it has been decided to accept his
account, when differing from the latter work.</p></div>

In answer to an inquiry from General Macleod about these guns,
Major Dickson, writing from Oporto, on 27 Aug. 1811, said: “They were
brass Portuguese guns of the time of John IV. and his son Alfonso,
bearing dates 1646, 1652, and 1653, &amp;c.; also some Spanish guns of
Philips III. and IV.&mdash;dates 1620, 1636, &amp;c.”</p></div>

 “On the 10th August an engagement took place with a body of the

of the Allies. This force was driven in by General D’Urban, but made
another attack. General D’Urban ordered the Portuguese cavalry, with
which was Captain Macdonald’s troop of Horse Artillery, to charge.
Before reaching the enemy they were seized with panic and fled, leaving
Macdonald’s guns, which had been moved forward in support, utterly
unprotected. The exertions of the troop got the guns moved off, but
owing to the state of the ground, three got damaged and fell with
Captain Dynely and their detachments into the enemy’s hands.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Browne.</span></p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
